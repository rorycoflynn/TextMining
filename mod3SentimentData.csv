AIart,The first trailer for Marvel s upcoming Fantastic Four movie looks great and people seem generally excited about it However a poster released for the movie online by Marvel led to some backlash as some believed it was created using AI image generation But Marvel is pushing back and claims that s not the case On January Marvel and Disney released the first teaser for The Fantastic Four First Steps The day prior the studio had teased the teaser with a teaser one that included a very annoying and overused sound effect But today we got a good look at Marvel s first family as portrayed by Pedro Pascal Vanessa Kirby Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss Bachrach I m digging the retro futuristic vibes of the trailer and the Thing looks amazing like Jack Kirby s drawings fully realized in live action But one of four posters released online for The Fantastic Four First Steps features some oddities that led many to wonder if AI generation played a hand thank you in its creation But according to The Wrap a Marvel spokesperson claims that AI wasn t used to create any of the Fantastic Four posters Here s a high res version of the poster that has caused all the backlash online I got this from Marvel s official social media accounts While fans online have spotted a few discrepancies the biggest red flag according to many is in the middle left of the image You can see a man holding a flag and it looks like he has only four fingers Let s zoom in and check that out Hmmmm it does look like this man is missing a finger So does that automatically mean AI was used to create these posters Well I m not sure about that Let s all put our pitchforks down for a moment okay First off the other three posters don t seem to contain any obvious AI artifacts It would be odd to only use AI on one poster Secondly some of the other discrepancies in the poster like the same woman s face popping up twice can be explained by someone assuming that people weren t going to zoom in on every pixel of every human in the image They likely had a set number of assets and limited time and reused some stuff in Photoshop when putting the poster together As for the hand with four fingers here s my theory It s possible that the pointer finger is resting unseen behind the flag pole to stabilize it while waving It s an odd way to hold a flag I grant you but it would explain the missing finger Or maybe AI was used in the poster s creation by one artist who didn t tell anyone and Marvel isn t lying but instead is not fully aware of the situation I ll be curious to hear more about Finger gate soon I mean Marvel did use AI to create the awful looking opening credits for s Secret Invasion The Fantastic Four First Steps arrives in theaters on July and kicks off the next phase of the MCU,0.9979,positive

AIart,Buried in a talk on AI from an artist who is doing cutting edge video work was the following nugget that entirely sums up the zeitgeist The tools are changing so fast that artists can t keep up with them let alone master them before everyone is on to the next And while you might think that this concern is only relevant to those who have to stay on the crest of the hype wave the deeper question resounds with every hacker When was the last time you changed PCB layout software or refreshed your operating system What other tools do you use in your work or your extra curricular projects and how long have you been using them Are you still designing your analog front ends with LM s or have you looked around to see that technology has moved on since the s OMG you re still using ST F s It s not a simple question and there are no good answers Proficiency with a tool like for instance the audio editor with which I crank out the podcast every week only comes through practice And practice simply takes time and effort When you put your time in on a tool it really is an investment in that it helps you get better But what about that newer better tool out there Some of the reluctance to update is certainly sunk cost fallacy after all you put so much sweat and tears into the current tool but there is also a real cost to overcome to learn the new hotness and that s no fallacy If you re always trying to learn a new way of doing something you re never going to get good at doing something and that s the lament of our artist friend Honing your craft requires focus You won t know the odd feature set of that next microcontroller as well as you do the old faithful without sitting down and reading the datasheet and doing a couple finger stretching projects first Striking the optimal balance here is hard On a per project basis staying with your good old tool or swapping to the new hotness is a binary choice but across your projects you can do some of each Maybe it makes sense to budget some of your hacking time into learning new tools How about ten percent What do you think I still use a dubiously obtained Adobe Photoshop from for all my graphic work I know it very well and it s totally free to use forever It can t save to whatever the latest format hotness is but it can work in jpgs pngs and even animated gifs and that s good enough for me All you suckers paying a subscription to Adobe need to ask yourself do you really need AI background replacement Yes I do I actually have a job where I use that stuff And I regularly need like five or six other things from the suite At least I can cancel my Autodesk subscription and use Blender which has finally caught up enough to be a viable almost full replacement I know that one day Autodesk and Adobe will fuse into one big obvious monopoly cartel and nobody will do anything but that day is not today Surely of what you use Photoshop to do can be done by a version from but I get it if you have a professional need pay for subscription I tried to use the Gimp for a month when I was in Costa Rica with a work laptop I couldn t get Photoshop to install on and it was most unpleasant But I m a software developer and only need Photoshop for quick and dirty buttons or whatever when I m not doing the usual cropping or color balancing on personal photographs Oddly enough I did time in the US for drug trafficking and as far as my valuable time what makes it valuable is that I can do what I want with it Amazing how that works Oddly enough I am often times a proponent of buying things that are off the shelf solutions when they make sense We all have our own decisions to make what it makes sense to farm out and what to do yourself Also consider cars I drive cars trucks construction equipment and motorcycles If felt a repair was out of my experience beyond my abilities to safely carry out do you think I would want me driving around in it I am sure most people feel the same way I won t disagree with you that many people are not too concerned about the rest of the world but in this case their ass is on the line too You make an excellent point about the value of personal time something I must price extremely cheaply in my brain because I always want to do EVERYTHING even if I don t know how to do it I ll watch a YouTube video and then just do it Usually this works out okay for me but wouldn t my time be better spent doing something I am extremely good at instead of things that are going to take me twice as long But then I call a plumber to install a sensor on water heater at a rental property and he quotes a figure of So I buy the part and spend minutes doing it myself the money I just saved is much more than I could earn doing what I do professionally Oddly enough I use GIMP for all my photo manipulation I ve been using it since about We have a licensed copy of Photoshop at work My attempts to use it were most unpleasant Nothing is where I expect it The names of the menu entries are all funky Nothing matches what I expect It is in very large part just what you are used to but that is a VERY large part of it the same I have all the latest and greatest Adobe apps through work but all they do is clogging disk space because I know my way around Gimp Inkscape and Kdenlive and Adobe feels incredibly nonsensical and hard to use Yup background removal saves hours literally But also the other tools in the suite move on and INDD you do have to keep updating to be able to exchange files Can t agree more I still use an older version of photoshop Learned it well I always get the job done efficiently Blocked it from calling home and never had any issues Never had to waste time when opening the app that it would block it s use until I upgraded which would interrupt my workflow Would never upgrade to a subscription model Getting milked for using an app is pure profiteering without any real benifits Keeping my computer apps isolated from calling home has kept my workflow fluid Obviously not all apps can be blocked if specific internet use is required or a major fix is necessary for repairing annoying bugs Online file conversion or separate apps resolve compatibility issues when working with newer photoshop formats Being technically savvy helps but colleagues who aren t succumb to purchasing the subscription model Unfortunately I think I look at it from the other direction There are solved problems and unsolved problems Solved problems for me are the CAD software I use and the Circuit design layout software I d still be on Eagle if it weren t for that damn company And then there are unsolved problems like the actual project I m working on and how to get this part to interact with that part in just the way I want On the other hand I completely abandoned hand written code once I tried AI Now I just ask the Great Intelligence to write the great majority of my code for me and then the only problem to solve is tweaking it to be exactly what I want So no and yes If the tool is compelling enough it ll get into the mix What kind of code do you write Do you have a github repo or something we can see the code AI generated I m curious because the time I tried to use it to write embedded systems code it wasn t so helpful of course I was new to using it too Almost all the code I need is simple Arduino stuff The last one was an ESPNow implementation and a Python based UI to match Both of which aside from simple changes it nailed easily Claude ai works well for me I haven t written real code since SQL was in its infancy On a smaller level a retired co worker found some mm home movies and wanted my help in putting them on DVDs for Christmas gifts I used the Windows movie maker from Windows and on different PCs to do the deed I found the video stabilizer from works a lot like it used to on YouTube before they removed it Whatever codec is needed is present on Windows so I used it to do the burning I know there are way better ways but I m working with what I ve got and my co worker was able to hand them out as priceless gifts to his family This a little awkward but it works and is pretty fast so why not On the other hand learning new tools is usually a net good in any case but mostly rewarding when the new tool is actually user friendly Doing that complicated and highly accurate interrupt routine on that atmel bit might feel at home But on the other hand doing the same thing on the pi Numbers might be simpler to the point that you ll spend an hour either case And if you re putting a hours into something then hr here or there does not really matter You might even save time doing both Though myself I usually go for the cheapest option this should really be doable for less than and then never really get done mostly because preoccupied with life in general But doing something cost effective usually also takes more time so that doesn t help getting done Tools change Good design sense accumulates in i bought a license of zbrush v for For years Pixologic gave me free updates Maxon gave me one final update zbrush after they purchased it from pixologic The upgrade to Zbrush the last perpetual license offered was priced at Thats more than I originally paid for an update not a new license Now Zbrush costs a year Thats ONE year for only less than i paid for my first years so Ill be using zbrush forever or at least until Maxon sells it to someone else and they start offering a reasonably priced upgrade or perpetual license I stuck with Rhino from until when I scraped part of a stimulus check into a rhino upgrade Im still learning to use the new bells and whistles that brought me At to upgrade It will probably be another versions until I upgrade again Rhino maybe LOL Ive still got a set of socket wrenches I bought in high school to work on my first car If a tool still gets the job done why replace it Wait until you see how much literally everything else has increased in price since I keep up to date with Rhino since I use it heavily and it always has areas for improvement which McNeel do address if not on the timetable I d prefer That being the case subscription pricing wouldn t make much of a difference financially and the same was true with pre CC Adobe products The bigger problem with a subscription model is that the software ends up as a perpetual beta because developers aren t working towards a specific release that has to justify a specific price That s surely a big part of Adobe s quality control going from hero to zero in just a few years The problem is Rhino is going the same way They increasingly rush out the latest version before it s release quality and then they ll reply to bug reports by saying they re focused on fixing it in the next release It seems like an iron law of software that after the first couple of years quality only decreases I disagree about rhino rushing out the latest versions Rhino has always had their WIP next version available to existing users and has always relied on its user base for debugging and guidance No They just dont roll out incremental PAID updates for every bug fix but the WIP version is updated weekly At this point theyre doing an official update every years so thats years of development with debugging and community feedback Not bad for a small employee owned company And as for subscription pricing not making that much of a difference I just showed that under Pixelogic I paid and got years months of use with free updates While under maxon that would get me just shy of months use With a release schedule of years between versions Rhino would have to price their subscription at for it to not make much of a difference financially to always keep up to date But given my tendency to skip versions before making the rd upgrade they would have to charge mo for it to not make that much of a difference to me Similarly I BOUGHT adobe Substance Painter Designer and Sampler on steam for That trio costs yr to rent directly from adobe This July I break even with subscription cost and will enjoy free use from then on Subscription pricing DOES make a BIG difference If it didnt software companies wouldnt be switching from BUY to RENT models of distribution I prefer to spend my time on the creation side projects and invest in learning a new tool flow only when the existing one no longer works for me I also ride OS versions a long time I understand this puts me out of the cutting edge but I am still making cool useful devices and being very productive As I ve gotten older I also understand I don t have to follow every new thing I ve seen a lot of new things come and then die For example I can acknowledge how cool Kicad is and understand many of the advantages of using it but my old version of Eagle still suffices and I m very productive with it which allows me to complete projects faster Someday I ll have to move off of it and I will without a second thought and I bet that Kicad is even better then I persisted with Altium for way too long before gritting my teeth and moving to KiCAD So glad I did Once learned I actually found it better but personal preference they are both effective tools just that one unavoidably costs and the other is free I donate to KiCAD because I use it for work I use an image viewer that was last updated years ago Apart from not understanding webp and non English character filenames it works perfectly Bruce Lee supposedly said something like I would rather face an opponent who practiced punches once than face someone who practiced one punch a thousand times I tell my kids to learn a new thing every morning and nothing worse will happen to you all day long That said some of my favorite tools hand planes and chisels I got from grandad and he got from his dad They are more than a hundred years old and still working just fine They sit on the bench next to a DeWalt cordless drill that I can hardly do without Use the best tools you can learn from them every day I wrestle with this question all the time as a professional educator Is it better to do the thing the way you can best do it Or spend time the most valuable resource learning some other way For example there is a task I can do in about seconds about maybe of the time The remainder of the time it takes like minutes if I mess up the first pass There is another way to do it that takes like minutes with about a success rate Which is better Still don t know Fortunately for the students kind of the whole point of being a learner is you are given the valuable time plus as student compared to a professional your time is worth way less to practice and learn new stuff For my part when working and not teaching I value my time at hr Somewhat arbitrary but hellos the mental calculus if it takes me or hrs to become proficient or better save it make me the equivalent Unless it s just fun Then it s a hobby and is expected to cost me money anyway My take is simple If AI tools of the future are so good they are so easy at making expertise in a task obsolete then whats the issue Current studies strongly indicate new AI fancy tools and applications reduce critical thinking in their users I think critical thinking is more important than a tool if you always design with ancient components and for some reason someone said you had to do something else something tells me you would be able to adapt with a tiny bit of friction and depending on your personality a grumble or two Some of the premise of this article is flawed as well Changing tools regularly can help deepen someones understanding of their subject matter Seeing the same material from different angles is a brilliant way to reinforce learning and is highly recommended by educators I haven t been around as long as some but most of these tools aren t all that different It s usually a matter of learning which levers to pull to accomplish a task Hmm I m curious about these studies you reference regarding reducing critical thinking My personal experience has been that you can t just turn your brain off and let the ai lead you along otherwise you end up completely in the wrong neighborhood It s a willful leading the ai towards a certain conclusion while the nitty gritty steps get done for you The Master builds his own tools Hardware wise I am slowly rebuilding my house ecologicly and selfsuffici ntly I do everything myself even if it takes me every winter to learn new skills that I apply in the summer Software wise I slowly switched to open source in the last decade Examples from MS Office to LibreOffice WSFTP to Filezilla PaintShopPro to GIMP and Inkscape SoundForge to Audacity still cheating sometimes Winzip to zip Premiere to Shotcut etc etc It wasn t always easy but worth the invested time in the long term Now running several identical unix workstations and windows laptops with the same stack using apt and choco With gratitude to the open source community Check out Ardour for sound for technical engineering stuff i think the solved vs unsolved problems sums it up sometimes churn is just churn and sometimes churn lets you explore a new problem space and i m immensely interested in those sorts of trade offs but each one i make with full particularity for art stuff i think it s a more interesting problem i ve applied my not invented here disease to musical instruments a couple times trying to build relatively exotic instruments that have crossed my path and when i build something new i am always impressed by how unplayable it is and that is obviously because i don t know how to build an instrument but also i buy a real instrument that has been refined over hundreds of years and it is nearly impossible to play too people develop full mastery over something unplayable like a flute where a new player can barely even make a sound let alone control it so when we have tools that have an artistic aspect i think it is a weird place to be where people are sometimes using the new tools before mastering the old ones we re facing an era where some tools are never mastered and we see a flood of newbie art because the old tool is so perceptibly dated even before anyone masters it a neat problem to have really I d use SuperCalc under DosBox if I could find a copy For the early s butt kicking math and graphing functions Indeed https archive org details supercalc msdos user copy You failed to ask the only important question are the new tools more useful Novelty doesn t guarantee utility There s no guarantee the people who make a new version of a tool even know how to use it Ask a hundred design students to reinvent the screwdriver How many will look like something out of a Tim Burton movie and how many will have a hexagonal handle that fits in an end wrench like the old Craftsman classic Which one would you rather use on a screw that s rusted in place The same is a hundred times more true in software There are graphics packages built and sold by people who have no idea how to send a job to a printing house There are CAD packages perfectly happy to draw hollow ball bearings with precision ground internal and external surfaces or fluid paths that are joined inside a block by an H shaped hole and all of them seem to assume that flat square parallel and exact dimensions just happen Meanwhile machinists call fillets the most expensive button in CAD Tools that last do so because they re useful We replace them when we find something more useful Novelty is more likely to be several steps back than a step forward KiCAD didn t replace Eagle because it was new Eagle was always a hot mess then someone at Autocad said what are the most idiotic license terms we can imagine for this user base As soon as KiCAD stopped being even worse people started to jump ship Good points all around I was assuming that you knew that the new tool had a feature that you actually wanted But your point is something deeper that you can be fooled into something worse by its shiny newness I m so reluctant to try out new tools that s not my problem The most expensive button is pretty funny fooled into something worse by its shiny newness Every version of Micro oft Word since Word v Um You might ve noticed my underwear has a has a hole in it it s uh You know i i I I don t see any reason to to throw it out It s The waist is still fine You know you can see see It s still real stretchy Peter griffin I m a fan of learning new tools if possible Even if it s just a new and better way of doing something within the current software such as using the new features in autodesk civil d for my day job Because even though you may feel comfortable with the way you do things with the pace things move today others may start to see the holes in your underwear that you think is fine but shows you are behind the curve It seems like there are at least a couple of important variables related to scale If you are just doing your own thing for your own amusement your freedom to use whatever idiosyncratic methods amuse you whether that means something that hasn t changed in absolute ages or a certain amount of not really justifiable adoption of new tools because the project is in part an excuse to futz with new tools is basically unlimited If you are working with others or pulling from others work or doing things at least in part for them to be useful to others you now have to consider either finding some mutually acceptable overlap or the amount of time and effort involved in porting things between different ways of working Similar thing for scale if you are doing once offs have a lot of freedom to continue using some part for a decade or more after the vendor starts issuing dire warnings about using it for new designs or use something that would normally be unaffordable because hey this particular model of obsolete thin client was actually implemented in a quiet beefy FPGA because a dead startup needed a minimum viable product well before they had an ASIC sorted out If you need to build a thousand of something though you probably actually need to care about what s current and what s cost effective now To put this in perspective some artists use brush and paint to do portraits just like medieval times instead of using modern digital cameras The tools don t matter if the result achieved suits its market or purpose Sometimes the new tool doesn t produce the same result Carpenters have mostly replaced planes chisels and scrapers with sanders The planes and scrapers can get a very nice shiny surface on the wood but you need skill to get there The sander can be handed to anyone and they can a smooth surface down to a line easily Almost as fast as the skilled person w the edge tools Agreed At least in the carpentry case hand planed is a different quality But if I use Platformio or makefiles nobody else knows There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding here As long as the tool you are using does the job and does it well you don t change tools How often should a mechanic throw their wrenches out and buy new ones The DESIRE to have the new shiny is part of the problem and is an infection that is intentionally spread by those who want your money Why would I WANT to learn an entirely new interface for my mostly the same phone every months just because some UX designer needs to justify their job to a company that needs to make their product number go up My phone is a tool The more time I have to spend learning where the same setting got put THIS version the less time I have to do other things Oh no I ll miss out on icons with rounded corners or something Having a clean UI that is useful is great But is one step or more less important than being able to just use the tool But ART That is about exploring The job of an artist is to push the boundaries and express thoughts The problem we have here is both kinds of work being treated he same way And the art way is sexy and new so that s what a company is going to push Also Generative AI is theft If you can t replace the term AI in your statement with a search

AIart,Peter Kafka Chief Correspondent covering media and technology Here s a conundrum for Big Tech companies Do they follow the president s orders Or do they follow the law That s what the likes of Apple Google and Oracle are grappling with following a chaotic weekend that saw TikTok voluntarily shut itself down in the US then restart less than a day later claiming that President Trump said it was OK to do so A couple of problems with that argument Donald Trump wasn t president of the United States this weekend Joe Biden was still in the White House And yes Trump immediately signed an executive order after he once again became president on Monday telling TikTok and other tech companies to ignore a law that says TikTok can t operate in the US while it s owned by a Chinese company But it s far from clear how much weight Trump s order holds So in the very near term attorneys and executives at tech companies need to decide whether they re willing to take Trump s word or if they need additional assurances At the moment it looks like Oracle controlled by Larry Ellison a Trump backer is going with Trump s assurances and is providing cloud services that are keeping TikTok running in the US Apple and Google which used to distribute TikTok via their app stores don t seem convinced TikTok disappeared from their stores on Sunday and has yet to return That means US users can have all the TikTok they want but it prevents TikTok from updating the app for maintenance and repairs something that could eventually cause problems I ve asked Oracle for comment Google declined to comment and Apple didn t respond to requests for comment One possible out for Google and Apple Trump has ordered his attorney general who seems likely to be Pam Bondi to send letters to Apple Google and other providers giving them the all clear to ignore the law But Bondi isn t attorney general yet and even when Apple et al get that letter it s not clear whether it will be enough to satisfy them I m not going to get into the weeds about the nature of executive orders vs laws or whether Trump s claim that he can at least temporarily override a law because of national security concerns would hold up in court Suffice it to say that there isn t any clarity about any of this Even Trump allies like Sen Tom Cotton and House Speaker Mike Johnson have put out statements that seem to conflict with Trump s statements The point is that no one can say with a straight face that they have confidence about whether the law passed overwhelmingly by Congress last year and upheld by a unanimous Supreme Court decision last week is binding That s an astonishing place for us to be It s also not one that we can pin completely on Trump In his last days in office Biden also said he wouldn t enforce the law he signed last year though he did it via anonymous officials speaking with reporters and eventually his press secretary and not via an official order At the same time some Democrats who voted for the bill in the spring like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spent the past few days arguing that the ban in the sell or ban law they approved should be delayed But Trump is taking the uncertainty and supercharging it In social media statements and a press conference he held Monday he seemed to suggest that the US government itself might end up owning TikTok Or that maybe it would be American companies that own half the operation He also argued that TikTok s Chinese ownership really doesn t matter since the US already uses lots of other stuff made in China like telephones And that even if China is snooping on US users that probably also doesn t matter because TikTok is mostly used by kids and If China s going to get information about young kids I dunno To be honest I think we have bigger problems than them It s worth watching all three minutes of this White House press conference clip just to get a sense of how off the cuff Trump seems to be treating the whole thing Imagine running a trillion dollar company and being forced to decipher this President Donald Trump shared his views on TikTok as he signed executive orders in the Oval Office on inauguration day news tiktokban trump donaldtrump We have been here before of course America and the rest of the world spent much of the first Trump administration trying to figure out whether Trump really meant what he was saying or if he could actually act on what he was saying and whether he d change his mind a little while later One big difference this time around Tech executives along with many other US leaders are scrambling to tell Trump how supportive they are of his presidency this time But it s one thing to praise Trump or cut him a check or to be conspicuously on camera during his inauguration Trusting that his say so is good enough to get you out of trouble for violating a law if that s what actually happens is brand new ground Jump to,0.9863,positive
AIart,Generative AI has rapidly advanced AI generated images are now photorealistic and generative AI tools are integrated into compact Android phones However AI generated videos have lagged behind AI generated images in quality OpenAI s Sora aims to bridge this gap setting a new benchmark for AI generated videos This guide provides an overview of Sora and its key features An agent of the human will an amplifier of human cognition Discover the power of generative AI Sora introduced by OpenAI in February and launched publicly in December is an AI model that generates videos from text descriptions Available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users Sora s name a Japanese word meaning sky reflects its limitless creative potential The development team including researchers Tim Brooks and Bill Peebles chose this name to represent the model s vision OpenAI describes Sora as a step toward creating AI systems that understand simulate and interact with the physical world OpenAI is igniting the AI revolution with bold projects and visionary alliances Sora uses a hybrid approach combining diffusion modeling and transformer networks The process begins with random noise akin to static on a TV which is gradually refined into detailed video frames The transformer network handles spatial and temporal complexities such as varying video durations and resolutions This hybrid design leverages transformers for layout and composition while diffusion models add textures and fine details Building on DALL E and GPT advancements Sora also employs a recaptioning technique that generates detailed captions for visual training data improving its ability to follow user instructions when creating videos Sora offers a suite of tools designed to facilitate video editing and storytelling Here s an overview of Sora s features Modify elements of existing videos while preserving the core narrative Adjust colors replace backgrounds and tweak visuals to align with themes or creative goals Trim or extend video segments for precise pacing and flow Select key moments and Sora generates seamless additional footage to bridge gaps Create repeating video clips for continuous playback Adjust the start and end frames and Sora ensures smooth transitions with additional frames if needed Plan every video detail using a timeline and action sequencing tool Caption cards serve as a narrative workspace and the timeline shows the event sequence Proper spacing between storyboard cards is essential Cards placed too close can result in jarring cuts while too much spacing adds unintended details Merge two videos into a single composition combining visual elements colors or styles Use the curve tool to control how clips influence the final result over time Sora introduced ethical safety and societal challenges Its ability to generate highly realistic videos from text prompts raises concerns about deepfakes These videos contribute to misinformation and damage trust in digital content There s also an ethical problem with unauthorized depictions of people since they pose a privacy risk and psychological harm To address these concerns OpenAI implemented multiple safety measures According to its system card Sora is subject to strict content restrictions It blocks videos featuring extreme violence explicit material hateful imagery and the unauthorized use of intellectual property or celebrity likenesses It also limits depictions of real people to reduce impersonation risks Transparency measures include visible and invisible watermarks C PA metadata on generated videos Despite OpenAI s precautions Sora is unavailable in the UK Switzerland and the European Economic Area due to legal barriers OpenAI is actively working to resolve these issues And is it the answer to safely deploying AI Sora has Pro and Plus subscription plans The Pro plan priced at per month comes with credits for up to videos per month with a maximum video duration of seconds and resolution of up to p The Plus plan costs per month and offers credits for up to videos with a second video limit and a resolution capped at p According to users actual usage often falls short of advertised limits and depends on video editing parameters From a technical perspective Sora struggles with accurate physics and movement It performs well with basic actions like walking but fails complex movements such as dancing or gymnastics Object interactions can be inconsistent Subjects sometimes shift unnaturally or disappear Like image models achieving optimal results requires iterative prompt refinement Sora is still under development but it holds massive potential It will simplify video creation for various purposes It lets users produce professional quality videos without requiring technical expertise or expensive equipment Filmmakers and designers can use Sora to quickly bring concepts to life develop storyboards speed up workflows and minimize costs In research and development Sora generates synthetic data to support training AI and machine learning models and provides tools to visualize complex scientific concepts Sora can also simulate realistic emergency scenarios in healthcare aviation and other industries reducing the associated expenses with traditional physical simulations Data is everywhere and there is not a drop to drink thankfully semi supervised learning can save the day Sora faces competition from platforms like Runway Google Veo and Luma AI each offering unique features in the emerging text to video field Runway s Gen Alpha subscription costs annually whereas its Gen version is free Google Veo anticipated to launch soon received early praise from users and creators including Donald Glover Luma AI s Dream Machine allows up to free daily generations

AIart,New guidance from the US Copyright Office says AI images and the prompts used to create them are not copyrightable There are a lot of legal and ethical debates surrounding AI generated images and videos and questions surrounding copyright are up near the top of the list On Wednesday the US Copyright Office released a new report that tries to provide some clarity around the issue of if AI and AI edited images can be copyrighted The report argues that copyright protects the original expression in a work created by a human author even if the work also includes AI generated material Images that are wholly generated with AI are still ineligible for copyright protection The report is the second in a series from the Copyright Office with this edition specifically focused on what it calls the copyrightability of AI generated and AI edited images The Office first issued guidance around AI in March of followed by a series of online listening sessions for the public to contribute their thoughts The series will have three reports the first was released last July and dealt with AI replicas like deepfakes and robocalls impersonating politicians The arguments and recommendations in these reports aren t law but they give us some insight into how the agency is viewing or in this case evolving its guidance to account for the legal and ownership challenges new AI tech presents One key thing that the Copyright Office highlights is the level of human contribution meaning how hands on a real human is during the creation process This is important because as the report correctly calls out a lot of popular editing software have recently gotten AI powered updates Things like de aging tools in film post production and photo editing features that clean up unwanted objects and photo bombers have been around for years but some of them now use AI to the dismay of some creators That kind of assistive AI is different than a person writing a complex prompt for an AI image generator and as such the use of that AI powered editing program shouldn t prevent a filmmaker or photographer from retaining copyrights over their works There is an important distinction between using AI as a tool to assist in the creation of works and using AI as a stand in for human creativity the report says On the other side AI image prompts are not copyrightable as the Copyright Office argues that the final images are still the AI s interpretation of the person s prompt The same prompt can produce endless and differing outputs meaning the AI has more involvement in the act of creation So far guidance like this from US agencies and court decisions create a kind of hodge podge legal framework for creators when it comes to AI images and videos The new year and new administration might bring new legislation or changes but we ll have to wait and see For more on AI check out everything we know so far about DeepSeek and how to turn off Apple Intelligence,0.9881,positive

AIart,We always enjoy videos from the Mathologer but we especially liked the recent video on the Helicone a toy with a surprising connection to mathematics The toy is cool all by itself but the video shows how a sufficiently large heliocone models many natural numbers and acts as Mathologer puts it acts as microscope to probe the nature of numbers The chief number of interest is the so called golden ratio A virtual model of the toy allows easy experimentation and even some things that aren t easily possible in the real world The virtual helicone also allows you to make a crazy number of layers which can show certain mathematical ideas that would be hard to do in a D print or a wooden toy Apparently the helicone was John Edmark s sculpture inspired by DNA spirals so it is no surprise it closely models nature You can D print a real one Of course the constant makes an appearance Like fractals you can dive into the math or just enjoy the pretty patterns We won t judge either way We ve seen math sequences in clocks that remind us of Piet Mondrian In fact we ve seen more than one of those Mathematics were always meant to be interpreted visually Source Some people think visually some don t Also the invention of language for scientific concepts is not a trivial process and visual representations may be stopgaps while language is catching up The source would be every system of conveying math especially for trade The majority of surviving early structured writing are trade documents and contracts For me seeing a short film in middle school math class showed me in such little time something that all the book bound numbing numbers and teacher talk simply failed at Absolutely Math dyslexia was rediscovered early in this century but they knew about it in the s Should such students be exempted from heavy math courses and be steered towards worthwhile studies It s no different than being physically handicapped and phys ed classes I was diagnosed back then and of course they came to no conclusion You ll just have to try harder at math bla bla blah Then why could I know the answer in a lot of visual geometry problems and everyone else had to do the math the hard way and even then had no idea what it s about The term for it is Dyscalculia and it has some interesting software based treatment attempts As usual wikipedia has a good overview https en wikipedia org wiki Dyscalculia Fantastic Love this post and will pursue similar models both virtual and physical Thanks Absolutely the best video I ve watched in a long time thank you for your efforts making mathematical and visual magic mesh with Christmas cheer Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent Comment Policy This site uses Akismet to reduce spam Learn how your comment data is processed By using our website and services you expressly agree to the placement of our performance functionality and advertising cookies Learn more,0.9982,positive

accounts rather than crypto Facebook was down accounts then the next week back up Facebook full of NPCs With that kind of volatility people might start investing in Facebook accounts rather than crypto I started developing D content professionally in about a year after joining Second Life and we called ourselves metaverse developers back then My company made k in at the peak of the hype cycle and petered out with the subprime crisis I also founded the SL wiki later hosted by wikia now fandom https www secondlife com secondlife com https secondlife fandom com fandom com https betatechnologies info betatechnologies info My complaint about VR is that it s not and never has been interesting I have yet to see anything that I find exciting or more than mildly interesting and definitely not anything that would convince me to buy expensive hardware Lone Echo is the closest experience you can have to actually floating in space It s magical There are many more experiences to be had like that in VR where the medium very very successfully tricks your body into believing that you are actually in that virtual world You can t experience that without actually experiencing it in VR Looking at videos of such an experience is like seeing an ad for HDR content on an SDR screen But VR is not cool It was cool years ago Today it is like huh Boring Not sure it was that cool back then either It had a few fans but felt more like a loud niche I still don t get it Phones are too small and monitors and TVs are always around Even with the giant large screen TVs someone s looking at a x inch screen showing Star Wars Partly my eyes were never good enough even with glasses to see something that small Now that I m older it s just silly to attempt it Good points Kids have very good eyesight They are also smaller than adults Small hands tiny fingers they can see things and do things that adults especially older adults can t which is why older adults can t understand why the kids are so enamoured with tiny devices with tiny buttons and tiny screens Sure but it goes the other way too Adults remember proper buttons with tactile feedback and instant response Kids are used to touchscreens that have lag and need to be pressed swiped just right and think that this is normal Good points Kids have very good eyesight They are also smaller than adults Small hands tiny fingers

right and think that this is normal SL is not VR though more like a game engine where you can collaborate with people and see what they do using the included construction tools Massively Multiplayer Online Blender for Dummies There is an OpenSim project where you can get a server for free and experiment with this D streaming technology It is quite an achievement in distributed physics simulation You can fly around with things attached and they will have scripts inside them which run seamlessly as you cross from server to server and But when he was bowing to the previous administration it was fine right Who did bowing I don t remember people cleaning Biden s shoes with their tongues but that s what we ve seem to have now Now if there was a great leader I could understand high tech bros being fond of them but Biden wasn t one of those great leaders Unfortunately Trump is worse Not just a bit worse but hugely worse He s a simpleton surrounded by sycophants who applaud his toilet training progress At least with mad king George III there were officials trying to keep things running properly Silly Slashdot poster how would Meta make any money off of this plan Cheap open and no

keep them coming to that open metaverse It doesn t need to be cheap people will drop on a decent VR headset What it needs to do is work seamlessly with my computer plug and play as it were no need for special connectors buggy software and definitely no requirement for an always online account I should be able to plug it into the USB and HDMI connections and have Windows detect it as a VR device

for who Zuckerberg That f ing thing costs at Costco I can eat for two months on that for a decent VR headset certainly is cheap Have you looked at the components That said my prediction is that something like the Samsung GearVR will come back and take over the low end of the market Meta has said they re looking at licensing their OS software Assuming VR stays around at all this seems incredibly likely to me phones were already powerful enough to get by a decade ago They should do quite well now Other advantages of the GearVR approach you could upgrade it as you upgrade y Also have a reason to go there Having the technology doesn t mean you ve got a product Like creating a new high end console that has no games and instead just shows ads all day that s like second life except the undead version I see this in some areas and companies they re too focused on the some structural parts but not on what customers might want Have an application that a customer might want Is that too much to ask Explain why it isn t second life with stereoscopic glasses because second Make a cheap possibly subsidised VR device and get it out there so people can come to that open metaverse That

nooo As another VR fanboi I totally second your summary This is absolutely the worst use of VR I could imagine They have relatively healthy revenue but they are just pissing money away chasing things no one asked for No one wants Horizon More people want VRChat than Horizon and that s still a tiny portion of the population The market would have sustained the more humble ambitions of Oculus that just wanted to make solid VR as a passion project Meta is just spending way too much money that would demand way more than this niche can deliver They have relatively healthy revenue but they are just

a phone without buttons There s no market for that It ll be a failure Now will Meta succeed Doubt it But the point is literally all markets are created by pissing away money into R D for something no

one asked for Heck no one asked for a car the horse was perfectly functional and cars were actively mocked for years before they started becoming While true the issue is scale and timeline From what I can find it s said that Apple invested less than million in bringing the iPhone to market Upon release it was very quickly evident it was a winner easily within the year of release If it had flopped Apple would have been out a fair amount but a tolerable loss Contrast with this where Facebook spent billion to acquire and according to this article over billion ignoring years of their expense in trying to expand it and still havi is the year of AI on your smarter watch It s a zombieIt s a bad idea that won t go awayThe ship is sinking abandon shipRun awayIt was once a strong contender for gold in the olympics of stupid ideas but now it s just a joke a bad joke I took a trip to the metaverse recently this is what I found Upon entering the city I was immediately treated to overhearing a heated argument about wether or not Naruto is racist I listened for a while and made my way across the plaza to what looked like some NBA themed experience Inside the NBA experience there were some not great VR minigames where you try to get a basketball in a hoop while in the background there was a frozen video of an NBA game You could play these minigames to earn tickets to buy hats for your avatar Nobody was playing the games so I left Next I went to The Office experience Inside was a flat shaded d modeled recreation of the set from the TV show It would have been interesting if it was a high quality photogrammetry capture of the actual set but this was just a d model somebody created based on watching the show In the break room there were kids laughing trying to figure out creative ways to smash the coffee cups There was some type of minigame you could play to win a hat but nobody was playing it and it looked boring I left and went to a red rocks DJ experience which was probably the best thing there There were maybe or so people all at the front of the viewing area where you can view a recording of a DJ show Unlike the NBA experience this video was actually playing and it was in D It was not entirely immersive it was more like a traditional concert video where the camera changes from the front to the back to the side etc This was the only thing IMO worth visiting but the experience was more clunky than simply going to the Meta TV app and watching the concert video Overall there isn t really anything interesting going on in there and its overrun with kids I was hoping to find educational content that would be interesting for adults like scans of real places or virtual museum installations or even a VR ted talk or something What I found was a bunch of extremely low effort interactive advertisements IMO they need to pivot away from content for kids The metaverse for kids is ROBLOX and they have a huge moat Get rid of the sponsored experiences and make something interesting for grown ups Monetization is going to be a huge problem either way Maybe make shopping experiences There s no reason why the IKEA vr app can t be in the metaverse instead of where it is now And honestly walking around a virtual IKEA where I could actually buy the stuff there would have been more compelling than anything I saw on my trip If the devs are reading this another great thing would be if meta acquired a photogrammetry company and integrated it with the messenger app so that people could upload d scans of their junk they are putting on FB marketplace A VR garage sale

AIart,If you buy something using links in our stories we may earn a commission This helps support our journalism Learn more Please also consider subscribing to WIRED The old adage is true The only things you can t escape in life are death and taxes In the US state requirements vary by a multitude of factors and the federal government s tax code is arcane The process can be as confusing as it is inescapable I ve researched and compiled all the information you need to prepare for the upcoming tax season I ve found answers to the most common tax related questions collected advice on filing for a small business or LLC and identified ways to get more money on your return Here s our guide on how to pay taxes online to get a maximum benefit and minimum headache this year Let s start with the basics Generally your return is due on or before the th day of the fourth month after the close of the fiscal year This is typically April If the due date falls on a Saturday Sunday or legal holiday it s moved to the next business day But taxes for most Americans are normally due April and this year is no different Your taxes must be filed by April As a proud April Aries tax day falls on the week of my birthday nearly every year I m actually paying Uncle Sam on my birthday Rude Tax season technically starts when the IRS begins accepting returns in late January Employers are required to give their employees W forms by the end of January so this is when the majority of Americans will receive the necessary paperwork to begin filing This year January is the official start date of the tax season Although it s largely dependent on when you actually get the necessary paperwork early filing is recommended to avoid potential issues and stress Filing early also reduces your chance of falling prey to identity theft where somebody poses as you to collect your tax return As a general rule for most things it s better to get an early start than get left behind One of the most straightforward ways to file your federal taxes is with the IRS Free Filing Tool It s a service offered directly through the IRS it doesn t use a third party tax service Anyone with an adjusted gross income of or less in is qualified to use the free service To start you ll need to choose the Free File option from IRS gov From there IRS Free File will send you to an IRS partner s website to complete your return These partners are software companies that are members of the nonprofit Free File Alliance a coalition of companies that offer tax software services to US citizens free of charge This is a good option if your income falls within the qualification guidelines and your return is relatively straightforward since this free service only has the most commonly filed forms You ll need to have documents ready like a copy of last year s tax return your social security number and any W s Once you ve filed your federal tax return you can check your online account for updates and you ll receive an email when the IRS has accepted your return The IRS website has a helpful step by step guide to walk you through the process and even has IRS certified volunteers to help with your taxes if you have a disability or speak limited English Since the IRS Free Filing tool is only for federal taxes you ll need to also check your specific state for its tax filing requirements The IRS website has a list of resources listed by state including taxation links for employers information on doing business in the state and more Although this list hasn t been updated since it s also a good jumping off point to find tax resources and forms specific to your state If you make more than or your taxes are a little more complicated like you own a small business then the IRS Free Filing tool won t work You ll need to do a little research to compare and see which is the best tax service for your needs but here are some of the most popular tax services available Filing taxes for small businesses or LLCs is a little trickier and that s where going with one of the tax services above with advanced programs and expert help can save you many headaches Generally the IRS treats an LLC as a corporation partnership or as part of the owner s tax return For income tax an LLC with only one member is treated as separate from its owner and is subject to the tax on net earnings from self employment If the LLC is a partnership normal partnership tax rules apply and all partners will need to fill out a Form US Return of Partnership Income Each owner will need to show their share of partnership income deductions credits and more If the LLC is a corporation corporate tax rules apply and it should file a Form US Corporation Income Tax Return Alright so you didn t file early We re chronic procrastinators here we get it If you can t file on time you should file an extension by the tax deadline This will push back your deadline to file taxes and protect you from possible failure to file penalties If you file an extension by tax day April it extends your filing deadline to six months later October But remember an extension of time to file your return doesn t mean the time to pay your taxes will be extended too If you fail to pay your taxes by April regardless of whether you were granted an extension then you could be asked to pay fines as well as interest on any unpaid balance This can result in penalties and interest but if you file as soon as possible you can minimize these penalties If you can t pay the full amount you can set up a payment plan with the IRS to pay in increments over the year If you forgot or just straight up didn t file for an extension and owe taxes you can face a late filing penalty maximum of percent of the unpaid tax percent late filing and percent for late payment This penalty is levied per month and it will continue to accumulate every month until it reaches percent of the unpaid tax at the time of filing The government also charges interest on unpaid amounts which varies depending on your amount and time owed You ll have to pay your balance in full to stop underpayment interest from accumulating daily The IRS typically issues your refund within days of receiving your e filed federal return if there are no errors or issues fingers crossed If you go old school and file a paper federal return it typically takes twice as long and could even take up to eight weeks to get a refund The timelines for getting state refunds vary by state but electronic filing usually results in faster refunds compared to paper filing In many cases if you file state taxes electronically you can get the refund in five business days or so and around four weeks if mailed When you file your federal income tax return you can check the status of your tax refund on the IRS website or on its mobile app IRS Go Remember each state has its own process and timeline for state income taxes Again paper returns generally take significantly longer to process than e filed returns Each state uses slightly different systems to let people check their tax refund status Generally you ll need two pieces of information to check your refund To check your status you ll need your Social Security number SSN If you don t have an SSN most states allow you to use a few different types of ID like an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number or ITIN In nearly every state you ll also have to provide the amount of your refund Sometimes you can round your return to the nearest whole number but some states ask for the exact amount Other states may also require additional information like your date of birth filing status or zip code I d suggest checking your refund on the IRS website first Just remember this is the government so your refund information may not be immediately available Your refund status should appear around hours after you e file a current year return three or four days after you e file a prior year return or four weeks after you file a paper return Remember you ll need your SSN or ITIN filing status and refund amount to check refund status Unsure of what tax rate you ll fall into It all varies on whether you re single married and filing jointly married but filing separately or the head of a household The tax rate goes in increments starting at percent for bottom earners making less than as a single person and increases up to percent for single or head of household folks making more than Here s a quick chart showing the amounts for the projected tax brackets from to be filed in Join the WIRED community

AIart,The usual suspects have decided to blame the fires on Democrats and DEI The usual suspects have decided to blame the fires on Democrats and DEI by Gaby Del Valle As fires rage across Los Angeles and tens of thousands flee their homes the usual suspects have decided to blame the blazes on their political enemies In a series of posts on Truth Social President elect Donald Trump claimed firefighters inability to get the fires under control was due to California Governor Gavin Newsom s water policies including an effort to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt by giving it less water it didn t work Meanwhile on X Elon Musk suggested that the fires were spreading due to the city fire chief s commitment to diversity equity and inclusion policies DEI means people DIE Musk wrote in a Wednesday night post Five people have indeed died in the Eaton fire thus far and upward of Los Angeles County residents are under evacuation orders according to the Los Angeles Times But the rampant spread of the fires isn t due to the delta smelt DEI or even as Trump Musk and scores of mainstream publications have falsely claimed cuts to the Los Angeles Fire Department s budget These claims aren t without consequence Last year FEMA workers received threats on TikTok and other social media platforms as rampant disinformation spread in the wake of the devastation caused by hurricanes Milton and Helene The first wave of disinformation focused on fire hydrants in the Pacific Palisades which abruptly ran out of water on Tuesday night as firefighters attempted to put out the initial blaze The hydrants Trump said were running dry because of Newsom s water policies I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful clean fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA Trump posted on Truth Social on Wednesday He is the blame for this On top of it all no water for fire hydrants not firefighting planes A true disaster In a separate post Trump claimed Newsom had refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water from excess rain and snow melt from the North to flow daily into many parts of California including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way Newsom s office responded on Wednesday clarifying that the declaration Trump referred to in his post didn t exist There is no such document as the water restoration declaration that is pure fiction Newsom communications director Izzy Gardon told CalMatters The Governor is focused on protecting people not playing politics and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need Mark Gold a board member of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California told the outlet that statewide water management policies including efforts to protect the delta smelt had nothing to do with the lack of water in the hydrants Tying Bay Delta management into devastating wildfires that have cost people s lives and homes is nothing short of irresponsible and it s happening at a time when the Metropolitan Water District has the most water stored in its system in the history of the agency Gold said It s not a matter of having enough water coming from Northern California to put out a fire It s about the continued devastating impacts of a changing climate The lack of water in the Pacific Palisades hydrants was instead due to a reduction in water pressure caused by increased demand the LA Times reported Janisse Qui ones the chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power told the paper that so much water was being used that the utility wasn t able to fill the tanks quickly enough The demand for water at lower elevations was also preventing the utility from refilling tanks at higher elevations according to the LA Times Wednesday night as powerful Santa Ana winds spread the fires to Altadena Pasadena and the Hollywood Hills right wing influencers accused city officials of slashing the fire department s budget and prioritizing diversity programs over sound fire prevention policy which Musk reposted on X But as Politico pointed out Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass didn t cut million from the fire department s budget a claim that has been repeated by critics on both the right and the left some of whom said Bass cut fire department funding to pay for a new police contract The fire department s budget actually increased by more than million over the previous year according to Politico though others have noted that LA fire chief Kristin Crowley criticized Bass decision to cut million from the department s overtime budget just a few weeks before the Palisades fire The reduction has severely limited the department s capacity to prepare for train for and respond to large scale emergencies including wildfires Crowley wrote in a December th memo This nuance is of course being lost on X where influencers have also begun posting AI generated

AIart,Project Zomboid s anticipated Build introduced more than gameplay enhancements The indie game s developer The Indie Stone faced backlash after players suspected generative AI was used in the game s new title and loading screen artwork Before any proof emerged accusations escalated to harassment conspiracy theories and hostility This controversy highlights the growing debates surrounding AI creativity for artists using generative tools and developers dealing with those opposed to their use The community s reaction to Build artwork sheds light on broader issues within the anti AI art movement It underscores the importance of redirecting efforts toward advocating for regulations on corporations while supporting small independent creators rather than unfairly targeting them Stop passing off machine learning tricks as real AI improvements Players on Steam and Reddit claimed inconsistencies in the new artwork were telltale signs of generative AI While the claims weren t unwarranted there were signs of AI artifacts the speculation snowballed before players confirmed anything with the developers This led some users to hostility accusing the developers of deliberately cutting corners avoiding paying artists and knowingly using AI generated content in bad faith Chris Simpson one of the game s developers addressed the controversy on Reddit He clarified that the artwork was commissioned from a professional AAA concept artist they had worked with since the same artist behind the iconic Bob on Car artwork Simpson stated the team was unaware if AI tools were used in the creation process but promised to investigate If anyone feels disappointed in us for failing to stop AI artwork from getting into the game that s fair enough and I personally apologize he said Despite no definitive evidence The Indie Stone removed the artwork to minimize further backlash Even if it turns out no AI was used it seems having them in the game would just continue causing grief Simpson explained As a digital artist and an early adopter of AI tools I believe generative AI was likely part of the artist s process but the extensive human touch is equally evident This highlights the persistent misconception among some anti AI advocates that generative AI is merely typing a prompt to plagiarize stolen artwork ignoring the nuance and skill involved in its use While many players voiced concerns about including AI artwork in the game most expressed support for The Indie Stone believing the developers acted in good faith and were unaware AI might have been used in the artist s process The majority rejected the aggressive tone of the accusations and harassment Some players even mocked the witch hunt by posting fake AI detection annotations on the original Bob on Car artwork from These annotations exaggerated minor details in the art which were created before AI tools existed to humorously highlight how obsessive scrutiny can lead to baseless conclusions Reddit user DoNotCommentAgain summarized this sentiment It s a vocal minority complaining most of us are just so happy for the update and proud of the work you ve done Keep it up While many players supported the removal of the artwork as a precaution they also condemned the harassment conspiracy theories and toxic behavior that overshadowed the broader conversation The more extreme elements of the anti AI movement have a history of hostility including calls for violence and even death threats These actions rather than fostering constructive dialogue about the ethics of AI art create a divisive environment that discourages transparency and harms developers and artists False information and toxic tactics undermine these valid concerns Through my investigation into the data origins of models like Stability AI s Stable Diffusion and a conversation with Spawning ai I found that much of the data was obtained legally through non profit organizations As it stands AI training and image generation do not violate copyright laws and are not legally considered theft Current copyright protections cover original works not styles or techniques This essential distinction prevents companies like Disney from monopolizing entire art styles and stifling creativity The backlash against AI art often stems from valid concerns including Creativity is no longer a solo human gig AI is crashing the party Harassment campaigns doxxing and conspiracy driven brigades frequent tactics among the more extreme anti AI advocates erode public sympathy and harm developers and artists Platforms like r ArtistHate amplify these behaviors fostering a toxic environment that discourages transparency and collaboration Presuming guilt before proof such as accusing developers or artists of wrongdoing without evidence violates widely held societal principles of fairness and justice Presuming guilt before proof such as accusing developers or artists of wrongdoing without evidence violates widely held societal principles of fairness and justice Premature accusations of guilt harm the individuals targeted and risk undermining the broader movement s credibility Addressing AI s impact requires constructive advocacy transparency and evidence based dialogue not the divisive methods that alienate potential allies and harm the people the movement seeks to protect Open dialogue becomes nearly impossible for developers and artists when transparency invites harassment and backlash Studios exploring AI tools must balance clear communication about their processes with the risks of hostility making constructive community engagement even more crucial Generative AI is integrated into widely used software like Adobe Photoshop becoming a standard tool for many creators Critics should focus on offering evidence based feedback While holding creators accountable is essential approaches rooted in conspiracies and vitriol undermine legitimate concerns about AI s impact on art gaming and society By shifting the focus from hostility to collaboration communities and developers can address ethical concerns while exploring the opportunities AI tools offer A balanced approach prioritizes systemic advocacy like pushing for corporate accountability in AI model training over targeting individual creators who adopt these tools responsibly Spawning ai confirmed that images will be removed from the most popular AI image dataset LAION B if you submit a request by going to Have I Been Trained AI hallucinations offer false information as fact Here s how this problem happens The debate surrounding AI art in Project Zomboid reflects larger questions about the future of creativity and technology across industries AI tools are advancing rapidly often surpassing human performance and edging closer to Artificial General Intelligence The concerns are real jobs are at risk low quality AI content is saturating the market and there are few safeguards to protect artists However many AI models can be run locally empowering individuals without relying on large corporations The ethical use of AI depends on the people welding these tools not the tools For developers like The Indie Stone the Build controversy is a stark reminder of the complexities of game development in the AI age For the gaming community and beyond it s an opportunity to rethink how we address these issues Frustrations over AI misuse could be better channeled into advocating for systemic change such as pushing for stronger regulations and corporate accountability One promising effort is Anthropic s Constitutional AI initiative which aims to align AI development with human rights and ethical principles Supporting initiatives like this and Spawning ai can help steer AI toward a more equitable and responsible future

AIart,Jan min read Yesterday I had a couple hours to kill and decided to try out a project I ve been meaning to explore for a long time training my own AI image model so I can generate pictures of myself that look like this Me as Superman I had a few reasons for wanting to do this What surprised me was just how easy it is to do something like this now I halfheartedly tried to do this or months ago and quickly gave up in frustration This time I built my model and was making pictures like the above in under hours coming in with basically zero knowledge Most of that time was just wrapping my head around the right tools to use In this post I ll quickly summarize what I did and how you can do it yourself The main things you need to make these models are If you ask ChatGPT Claude or even DeepSeek about how to do this they will probably recommend using Stable Diffusion for this but I remembered Pieter Levels who makes PhotoAI talking about a model called Flux that performs much better so I decided to use that as my base model Flux has an open source open weight model that is not state of the art but definitely good enough for my purposes For a training technique there are a bunch but the one that seems to be recommended today is LoRA Low Rank Adaptation I learned exactly as much about LoRA as I needed to but conceptually you basically train a tiny part of the model and associate it with a magic uncommon word that you invent e g czue Then when you prompt the model to create the invented word it is heavily influenced by that training data This ends up being much faster and more efficient than fine tuning the whole model and works well Don t ask me any follow up questions about this because that is the extent of what I learned Once you have your model you need a training set which is basically a bunch of pictures of the thing you want the model to learn For this part I just grabbed random photos of myself with different expressions scenes lighting angles The more diverse the dataset the better Also I think it s important that you re the only person in the photos I didn t try any with more than one person Some of the photos I used for my training set I tried to capture different angles lighting hairstyles and so on though sadly most of the photos I have are selfies As part of the training the model needs text descriptions for the model to learn from and these should I think include your magic word So for example you d upload a picture of yourself on the beach and if your magic word was czue you d then add a text description that said a photo of czue on the beach wearing a blue shirt That said you don t actually have to label your images yourself because the tools today will auto generate these captions for you with LLMs So you might read somewhere this is necessary but you can skip it since it gets handled for you At first I thought it d be fun to train the model on my laptop But I quickly ruled that out because I don t have anything close to the hardware necessary GPUs and lots of RAM Then I thought it might be fun to figure out how to run the code on some beefy GPU cloud server but I quickly bailed on that idea too and landed on Replicate Replicate is basically GPU rentals as a service But they also have a rich ecosystem of pre built stuff that you can spin up and run instantly So rather than write your own training code and install all the dependencies and such you grab someone else s recipe and just plug in the parameters you need For this use case I learned that the easiest way to train the flux model with LoRA is with the ostris flux dev lora trainer recipe You need to create a Replicate account and set up billing and then you can enter the parameters you need on that page which correspond to how you re going to train the model The most important settings Now would probably be a good time to mention that there are a bunch of YouTube videos that walk through this process in detail This is the one I mostly followed If you want to know more about how to fill in the training parameters you can watch that though the above covers the essentials After filling in everything you click Create Training and you re off Replicate shows you progress as it trains your model and will finish in about minutes You re done training Hugging Face is basically just a place to store and share models kind of like Github but for AI Using it is optional because Replicate also saves your model somewhere after training it but Hugging Face makes it easier to access and integrate your model with other tools later Plus it s free and easy to set up so I used it I created an account and empty model on hugging face and then plugged it in under hf repo id in the training form above You also need an access token which you can get from your hugging face settings page and then put under hf token If you do this step then when your model is done training your hugging face repo will be populated with your trained model This is basically a giant Mb file called lora safetensors In all worlds the model will also be available under the trainings tab in Replicate Ok payoff time The last step is to do some inference In other words give our model some captions and have it make pictures for us Again I briefly explored running this myself and again I quickly bailed and used Replicate In this case you can use the lucataco flux dev lora recipe for it The key modification you need to make is the hf lora field which should either be your hugging face repo ID it must be public for this to work or a link to your trained model on Replicate a trained model tar file from Trainings your training Download Weights Then put in a prompt being sure to include your secret word for the person you trained on Press Run and you should get a picture of yourself or someone who looks at least plausibly like you surfing Lekker You can also run your model programmatically via the API This is much faster for experimenting with different prompts saving images to your computer and so on Here s a simple Python script that demonstrates the process I ve also published it to Github and may make future updates there Most of the code is just plumbing around arguments and filenames and the acutal API call is a single line replicate run A Python script to run prompts against your model Also available on Github You car run this with e g Overall I ve found results have been mixed Sometimes the model produces something that looks quite similar to the trained person and sometimes it only has a mild resemblance One trick I ve found is that appending some extra hints about the person seems to help e g a year old man for me or a six year old boy for my son Without this prompt it was often turning my boys into girls and making other amusing mistakes Here are some example results for the prompt a photo of czue a year old man writing a blog post Versus a photo of czue writing a blog post Neither set is great but the first set is much closer to what I actually look like and more consistent with itself The second set is kind of all over the place Another thing I noticed is that it seems to break down if you try to include other people For example when I tried to put myself next to Barack Obama it kind of merged some of my features into his face and vice versa I m sure you can get better results by playing around with prompting I ve only really scratched the surface of experimentation But overall the results have been good enough that both me and my kids have had fun making pictures of ourselves in different scenarios which was my primary goal Win This isn t free but it s also not expensive I trained three models one on myself and one on each of my kids The training costs were per model Then generating images is about image or for a dollar I ended up spending just shy under on the whole little experiment Not bad Overall this was a fun little exercise and I was happily surprised by how easy and cheap the whole process was If you ve wanted to do this yoursef but been intimidated by all the options and buzzwords hopefully this post is enough to convince you to give it a shot or use

AIart,Human effort is required but the bar is extremely low by Charlie Hall The United States Copyright Office a federal organization and a taxpayer funded public good founded in has issued formal guidance on the issue of AI generated content A document posted in January states that works lacking human authorship will not be protected by U S copyright However the requisite level of creativity required to fulfill that criteria is extremely low The document was also reported on by GamesIndustry biz More than comments from the public contributed to the U S Copyright Office s decision on copyrightability of AI generated works and the executive summary makes it clear that it considered all viewpoints before issuing its guidance As a matter of policy some argued that extending protection to materials created by generative AI would encourage the creation of more works of authorship furthering progress in culture and knowledge to the benefit of the public The Office also heard concerns that an increased proliferation of AI generated outputs would undermine incentives for humans to create While recognizing that copyrightability is determined on a case by case basis the Office sets out the legal principles that govern the analysis and assesses their application to AI generated content In its conclusions and recommendations the Office notes that it believes that issues related to AI can be resolved pursuant to existing law without the need for legislative change However it repeatedly stressed that whether human contributions to AI generated outputs are sufficient to constitute authorship must be analyzed on a case by case basis That likely means it will be useful for creatives to be able to show their work not merely point at the AI black box and the prompt that they gave it This document is merely the beginning however and not the end of what s expected to be a long journey through the U S judicial system that will be marked with fractious legal battles Issues related to the inputs used to create the AI model in the first place meaning whether or not large language models have technically stole from artists by scraping their content from the open web is largely outside the bounds of the document Nonetheless the ruling is poised to loom large going forward The Trump administration recently announced an executive order that aspirationally seeks to expand government funding for AI technology The initiative if funded is expected to benefit the nation s largest and most profitable tech companies Meanwhile individual creatives will largely be left to fend for themselves The best of Polygon in your inbox every Friday Vox Media LLC All Rights Reserved,0.995,positive

AIart,AI generated works of art may be eligible to win awards at state fairs but they are not protected under American copyright law according to new guidance issued by the U S Copyright Office USCO on Wednesday The report details ways in which AI generated video images and text may and may not be copyright protected It finds that while generative AI is a new technology its outputs largely fall under existing copyright rules meaning that no new laws will need to be enacted to address the issue Unfortunately for AI content creators the protections that are available are thin The courts have already ruled that AI systems themselves cannot hold copyright The Supreme Court specified in the case Cmty for Creative Non Violence v Reid CCNV that the author of a copyrighted work is the person emphasis added who translates an idea into a fixed tangible expression entitled to copyright protection Pointing to the inherent unpredictability of an AI s output to a given query the USCO s guidance argues that AI prompts don t offer the user a sufficient degree of control over the generative process to make users of an AI system the authors of the output That s regardless of how complex and expansive the prompt is No matter how many times a prompt is revised and resubmitted the final output reflects the user s acceptance of the AI system s interpretation rather than authorship of the expression it contains the report reads In short the issue is the degree of human control rather than the predictability of the outcome That denial of protection does have its limits however For example the Robert Zemekis film Here which featured digitally de aged Tom Hanks and Robin Wright has been copyrighted despite its use of generative technologies to do the de aging This is because the AI is wielded as a tool rather than treated like a producer Similarly the USCO argues that a film that includes AI generated special effects or background artwork is copyrightable even if the AI effects and artwork separately are not Artists are also covered to a degree if they re using an AI system to further modify their existing human made creative works The AI generated elements in the resulting content wouldn t be copyrightable since they were generated by the AI but the overall artistic piece and its perceptible human expression would be This issue is not a new one As far back as with the advent of computers the USCO has been wrestling with the question of authorship as to whether content produced on digital platforms is the work of human authors or simply written by the computers The crucial question appears to be whether the work is basically one of human authorship with the computer merely being an assisting instrument Then Register of Copyrights Abraham Kaminstein noted at the time or whether the traditional elements of authorship in the work literary artistic or musical expression or elements of selection arrangement etc were actually conceived and executed not by man but by a machine The USCO notes that its guidance on the issue could evolve in the coming years as the technology further matures In theory AI systems could someday allow users to exert so much control over how their expression is reflected in an output that the system s contribution would become rote or mechanical the report reads However the USCO has found that modern AI prompts simply do not yet rise to that level OpenAI s ChatGPT platform and Sora video generator have gone offline and are currently not responding to user queries Social media accounts began posting about the outage around p m ET on Thursday which coincided with a surge of reports to Down Detector The company confirmed the outage in a blog post at p m ET stating we are currently experiencing an issue with high error rates on ChatGPT the API and Sora We are currently investigating and will post an update as soon as we are able For the finale of its Days of OpenAI livestream event CEO Sam Altman revealed its next foundation model and successor to the recently announced o family of reasoning AIs dubbed o and mini And no you aren t going crazy OpenAI skipped right over o apparently to avoid infringing on the copyright of British telecom provider O Google s latest AI tool helps you automate image generation even further The tool is called Whisk and it s based on Google s latest Imagen image generation model Rather than relying solely on text prompts Whisk helps you create your desired images using other images as the base prompt Whisk is currently in an experimental phase but once set up it s fairly easy to navigate Google detailed in a blog post introducing Whisk that it is intended for rapid visual exploration not pixel perfect edits Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast paced world of tech with all the latest news fun product reviews insightful editorials and one of a kind sneak peeks,0.9669,positive

art,From post battle landscapes to cold weather fun the events that occurred during frosty temperatures have led many an artist to pick up their brush and get painting Winter landscapes have been a feature of art for hundreds of years and while many focus on landscape alone there are also some that allude to the historical context of their times or portray events from the more distant past Here is a chronological look at nine winter paintings that hint at or were inspired by actual historical events Pieter Bruegel s painting Jagers in de Sneeuw Hunters in the Snow is also known by the alternative title of Winter fitting for one of the most notable winter landscapes in Western art What s also notable is that it depicts the effects of the Little Ice Age a historical period from the th to the early th centuries that saw a series of extremely cold winters in Europe Bruegel s painting is set in the middle of this period and shows how this cold era in European history affected on the people living in it in ways both positive and negative In the background we can see people enjoying themselves skating on the ice but in the foreground are a group of hunters having returned with what looks like a meager haul from their quest through the snow England also felt the effects of the Little Ice Age and one enjoyable consequence of the freeze that became a part of London life were frost fairs which took place on the Thames during winters when it was cold enough for the river to freeze over Dutch painter Thomas Wyke captured a frost fair that took place during the exceptionally cold winter of in Thames Frost Fair It shows people setting up tents and stalls on the frozen river and a horse is pulling a cart across the ice in the distance is a bridge over the then icy waters According to History Today It was this Fair that set the pattern for the five that followed it The Thames would freeze over for the last time in British artist Joseph Mallord William Turner painted contemporary scenes as well as historical and mythical events and his painting Snow Storm Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps alludes to a genuine historical figure Hannibal BCE BCE was a general of Carthage who led his army to multiple victories against the Romans This painting shows a famous episode where he and his troops crossed the Alps on the way to Spain taking elephants along the way as he traveled through the snow Turner shows just one of the animals in the lower right corner of the painting some believe the figure on the elephant is Hannibal himself German painter Caspar David Friedrich was fascinated by images of humanity overwhelmed by nature as seen in his paintings of people contemplating vast landscapes like Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog and plants growing over the ruins of buildings The Abbey in the Oakwood This is also expressed in his painting Das Eismeer The Sea of Ice and also known as The Polar Sea which shows the wreck of a ship in fragmented sea ice It s believed that Friedrich was inspired by explorer William Edward Parry s Arctic expedition from and his search for the Northwest Passage The painting can be seen as an allusion to this historical episode despite its portrayal of a much bleaker outcome to a voyage through icy seas Parry and his ships made it home This painting alludes to history though not in the way that you might think American artist Frederic Edwin Church was inspired to create it after a voyage to the Arctic which was itself inspired by exploration of the region taking place at that time He named it The North as an allusion to the states in the northern U S which stayed together following the secession of other states during the American Civil War Church debuted the painting just days after the fighting began He later added the broken mast in the foreground and changed the title to the more literal choice of The Icebergs which is what the painting is most commonly known by today The painting Les patineurs Longchamp Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne by Impressionist painter Pierre Auguste Renoir not only shows a social wintry scene but also reflects a major aspect of the history of Paris in the th century In the s at the direction of Napoleon III Georges Eug ne Haussmann began renovations on the city that drastically changed much of its landscape One of the areas that was redesigned and revitalized was the Bois du Boulogne The park did not exist in this form until the decade before Renoir s artwork was painted and the image captures the sense that the park became what a paper published in The Journal of Western Society for French History calls a social and cultural institution and the epicenter of Parisian society in the late th century Some winter landscapes might at first glance seem like innocuous snow scenes but they turn out to be connected to more sobering events Manet s painting Effet de neige Petit Montrouge Effect of Snow on Petit Montrouge is one such painting It depicts the titular Parisian suburb of Petit Montrouge during what was actually a huge moment of crisis for France the siege of Paris during the Franco Prussian War Manet served in the conflict and the experience provided inspiration for later pieces of art as well This painting by Charles T Webber shows a scene of people traveling in winter with the help of the Underground Railroad the network that helped enslaved people escape their captors in th century America Webber a Cincinnati resident painted it as a tribute to the railroad conductors he had met in the city some of them even appear in the painting It has become an iconic image that is often used to illustrate historical articles about the subject of the railroad The painting was first exhibited at the Chicago World s Fair in and now belongs to the Cincinnati Art Museum This sombre painting shows an event from the First World War one in which the artist himself was involved John Nash s Over the Top depicts a counterattack at Welsh Ridge that took place on December Sixty eight soldiers were killed Nash was one of just survivors He painted it three months later and it continues to be his most famous work to this day Minute Media

art,The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface UEFI took over from the classical BIOS some years into the new millenium It s typically used for running a computer at the basic pre OS level and most of us don t even notice it past boot time However you can do some neat things in this space you can even port over Nyan Cat if you re talented like Cornelius Yes Nyan Cat is now available as a UEFI application running via the EFI Simple Text Output Protocol Cornelius approached this creation by first learning Rust before progressing to the Hello World stage Before long the computer was booting up to display a simple text message with no OS required From there creating the Nyan Cat animation required figuring out how to display it as a bunch of dancing characters which is where the Simple Text Output Protocol came in Nyan Cat was really the perfect animation for the UEFI environment since its simple pixel art style was easily recreated with text With a bit of work the animation came together with a remarkable resemblance to the original artwork All that s missing is a routine to play the music over a PC speaker only those are hardly a thing anymore A pity In any case if you ve been cooking up your own nifty UEFI hacks don t hesitate to drop us a line I consider UEFI a major security threat My rig uses Gigabyte EP DS L mobo and C D E CPU It s still more than enough to run web browser gcc CLISP LISP intrerpreter for Windows Red Faction Guerilla and Gothic TrueCrypt also works like a charm on this setup and provides deniable security in case I ever get raided by ministry of internal security ABW or police Nobody s itching at the chance to poke holes in your UEFI to access data of crucial importance to national security like your Red Faction savegames and if they were it s not by sticking to BIOS that you ll keep them at bay And on the off chance you actually are a person considered dangerous by government entities it s quite irresponsible on your part to be gaming

tinyurl com avyj a Very nice technical achievement but a failure on the image processing side The original image has pixels in height stretching it to lines was a terrible idea and it completely breaks the pixelated style of the image Just needed to fill the extra lines with the background color and it would be perfect and if you don t have the space you can always use my master boot record version P https github com brainsmoke nyanmbr not true to the original and no sound but what do you expect from bytes P Interesting timing I was playing with the POSIX UEFI project https gitlab com bztsrc posix uefi over the weekend just to see what sort of toys I can make for it I think a Zork z machine would be a good fit for what s supported in the libc in POSIX UEFI or the capabilities of UEFI in general Maybe not as exciting as Nyan Cat But a working C environment is more my speed than learning Rust Another idea is a stripped down version of Rogue but getting an old build system to target something it was never intended to support can be a wild goose chase sometimes proof that UEFI bios are crap easy to install a virus tracker whatever into it and compromise the whole system with zero protection I still prefer UEFI Zork Lots of uefi is bad complainers here this only works if you set your firmware bios menu to allow it Secureboot is a thing and you can disable the automatic adding of external bootdevices to a bootselect menu As if yall forgot about optionroms just insert on the isa pci or lpc bus and away you go Now intel Me or csme today is another story and the way uefi is implemented or worse the defaults by some manufacturers is definitely debatable But the idea of uefi is pretty smart and secure enough especially if you can trust your own hardware SecureBoot is a non free software cannot be audited and since its encryption keys are owned by Intel Microsoft and Apple it s a de facto a government backdoor into any libre encryption code See Richard Stallman interview about UEFI to learn on how it presents a grave danger to libre software ecosystem Now intel Me or csme today is another story and the way uefi is implemented or worse the defaults by some manufacturers is definitely debatable To my knowledge there is no other implementation of UEFI in practice All manufacturers use the intel example code as a blue print sadly In simple words The history of UEFI is quite confusing But the idea of uefi is pretty smart and secure enough especially if you can trust your own hardware In my opinion OpenFirmware was the better cleaner alternative The design flaw with UEFI is that it is too complex It s more than just a firmware with a set of helper functions like BIOS was The UEFI is a miniature OS in its own regards and that s the flaw Though small is relative maybe Windows Amiga OS x Mac OS Toolbox or Atari TOS were just as small if not smaller Anyway the problem is that it can lie to the host OS and has network stack It s acting behind the curtain yet it has no firewall no online updater feature no anti virus software etc UEFI by view of an anti virus software can be described as a backdoor a trojan a memory resident

art,By James Doubek A lump of chewed up crinoid fragments from million years ago is now at a museum in Denmark Sten Lennart Jakobsen East Zealand Museum hide caption About million years ago just before the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs a fish chewed up and spit out some sea creatures Unbeknownst to that fish its rejected meal was preserved in fossil form And it s now arrived at a museum in Denmark The fossil was found at Stevns Klint a cliff in eastern Denmark known for its fossil record and important geologic history Fossil hunter Peter Bennicke discovered it in a piece of chalk at the UNESCO World Heritage site and brought it to Denmark s East Zealand Museum It is truly an unusual find Jesper Mil n a curator at one of the museum s exhibits said in a press release Such a find provides important new knowledge about the relationship between predators and prey and the food chains in the Cretaceous sea There s a fancy word for fossilized vomit regurgitalite Paul Olsen a professor of earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University who was not involved in the fossil find said regurgitalites are not rare but this one is an especially nice example This particular fossil if you look carefully at the image that s provided you see that the edges of the fossils are very sharp and clear And that tells you that this material did not pass into the digestive system of whatever was doing the chewing he says And to be technical it s not vomit because that means food reaches the stomach He calls it a gastric ejection instead likening it to chewing on and spitting out sunflower seed shells The predator was attempting to eat sea lilies also called crinoids The deep sea creatures which could be mistaken for plants still exist today The fossil also appears to contain bryozoans Olsen says very tiny creatures that are also called moss animals but it s unclear if they were part of the fish s attempted meal in this case Both crinoids and moss animals would be common in that area at the bottom of the sea at the time Unfortunately for this fish crinoids don t have much nutrition and have a coating of mucus that can be toxic to fish It could be that whatever made this regurgitalite was cruising about looking for fish maybe fairly desperate for food and picking up crinoids and whatever else it could in its mouth chewing it up And this particular mouthful may have been really foul And that s why there are still bits of unchewed crinoid in it he says There were thousands of species of fish in the area at the time so it s not clear what type of fish did the chewing Regurgitalites are one type of bromalite fossilized digestive material There are also colonites where the food was found inside the intestines and coprolites fossilized poop Bromalites are in turn part of the record of trace fossils They aren t the remains of the animal itself but of how it lived Regurgitalites give us a window into the feeding processes of various members of the ecosystem that were around at the time Olsen says These types of fossils are a wonderful illustration of things that were going on just before the giant asteroid impact normal life in the ecosystem It s a trace of that action It s a trace of the organisms doing their business on a daily basis Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor,0.8512,positive

art,Mixbox allows for more vibrant colors by treating them like physical pigments Artists like Allan Kaprow and Frieder Nake helped pioneer the emerging field of digital art in the s Since then technology has allowed people to explore their creative potential in new ways Even with recent advancements the medium still leaves some room for improvement The colors in many painting software programs like Adobe Photoshop and Procreate appear duller than real pigments That s why the creators of a new tool called Mixbox are changing the game Why do digital paints tend to look dull compared to the real thing A study PDF from the Czech Technical University in Prague explains that most graphic design software uses RGB representation This color model mimics the mixing of colored lights rather than physical pigments making combined shades appear muddled and less vibrant Actual paint behaves differently If you were to mix blue and yellow pigments the particles in the paints would absorb and scatter light reflecting green wavelengths Paint colors also gain saturation when combined with white whereas RBG colors lose it Paul Kubelka and Franz Munk accurately recreated these visuals and were the first to predict the behavior of paint mixtures with their research published in However their theory of light absorption and scattering via layering paint never gained widespread attention mainly because it s challenging for software developers to implement it Mixbox s approach to paint combines the Kubelka Munk model of pigment mixing with an RGB interface Users select RGB colors to mix while internally the software treats them like physical pigments resulting in saturated gradients transitioning hues and natural secondary colors during blending You can copy the necessary code from Mixbox s webpage in your language of choice which includes Python Javascript and more If you aren t sure where to start the site also provides coding examples and a demo painter to play around with Remember Mixbox isn t a plugin you can install into a pre existing design software like Photoshop It requires some coding knowledge to use If you lack that your other option is to contact the developers of your favorite painting program and ask them to adopt the tool Read More About Art Minute Media All Rights Reserved,0.9801,positive

being a loyal husband and father while toiling tirelessly at Spacely Space Sprockets headed by a domineering man with a Napoleon complex seems to float away as the zooming saucer like aero cars with large bubble roofs leave behind popcorn like residue from fuel pellets and radium Kenny Scharf was just four years and a month old when The Jetsons premiered depicting family and work life a century later in the year The painter and installation artist who rocketed to art world fame in New York City s interdisciplinary East Village art scene during the s alongside Jean Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring was when he painted Destination Fun Watching The Jetsons on Saturday mornings in the s and s I imagined that by now we d be living in a vertical city where homes and businesses are raised on

even if his failed floating Cybertruck lags real world flying car prototypes such as TF X BlackFly Helix and Jetson One At inches high by inches wide the acrylic on canvas with aluminum frame is one of the smaller artworks among more than paintings sculptures and objects created by Scharf since the late s on view at The Brant Foundation through February Co curated by industrialist and art collector Peter M Brant and art dealer gallery owner and artist Tony Shafrazi in close collaboration with the artist Kenny Scharf is a breathtaking survey compiled from the Brant collections alongside major loans from institutions and private collections including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and The Broad in Los Angeles Installation view Kenny Scharf at The Brant Foundation You can derive deviant joy from Scharf s surrealist psychedelic scenes but don t dismiss his whimsy as California dreaming There s far more to the picture than meets the eye My writer husband Mike our year old s counter culture loving son Michael and I delighted in meeting Scharf on November as we traversed the square foot East Village structure that served as a ConEd substation in s and as the home and studio of artist sculptor illustrator and composer Walter De Maria from the mid s until his death in It was amazing absolutely amazing Scharf said of viewing his vast oeuvre in the colossal Brant space I don t get that opportunity a lot I m hoping this is the beginning of a lot more opportunities a lot more of these kinds of things I enjoyed it a lot I haven t really seen things together for a long time some of it I ve never seen together So that s great It s kind of emotional to see your old friends see them all looking good out on display And it s very nostalgic because most of the work was older work that I haven t seen in awhile Exploring the square feet of exhibition across four floors with ceilings as high as feet we encountered many works for the first time including Scharf s Ultima Suprema Deluxa a behemoth Cadillac Sedan de Ville tricked out with customized paintwork and plastic dinosaurs as we exited through the gift shop I used to drive that around back when I painted it in the s Scharf recalled during a December Zoom It s crazy Kenny Scharf Self Portrait with Cadillac Oil on canvas x in Private Collection Kenny Scharf Scharf led me on a virtual tour of the gardens outside his Culver City Los Angeles cottage home thriving with cacti cannabis succulents and palm trees and adorned with installations made from found objects recycled household goods and travel souvenirs Though he made his global name in the s East Village and Lower East Side Scharf was first associated with the underground Lowbrow Movement that emerged in the Los Angeles area in the late s Mangoes passion fruits I have a lot of marijuana I have plums And here s the entrance and then we ll go inside and talk Here s my studio real quick if you want to see plants a lot of plants See the vines And then of course paintings Scharf said It s a pretty cool spot The most fertile time and place in contemporary art history the s East Village art scene remains unrivaled as the birthplace of Neo Expressionism Neo Pop and Street Art and for an enduring impact on any remnant of rebellious creativity energy left swirling like Scarf s ubiquitous and singular cosmic shapes I like the word remnants because that s what I see I see remnants Scarf lamented New York is always New York thank God but it changes like everywhere Though he returned to Los Angeles after a whirlwind visit for the opening Scharf s impact on the neighborhood Brant Foundation is in the East Village remains indelible Scharf s third solo show presented by TOTAH gallery in the neighboring Lower East Side MYTHOLOGEEZ was on view between September and December and his painted chair swing ride is showcased in Luna Luna Forgotten Fantasy an exhibition homage to the world s first art amusement park at The Shed through February It s decades of manifesting said Scharf of the concurrent exhibitions I ve known and been involved with Tony Shafrazi and Peter Brant for decades and I was there at the beginning when Peter was creating his foundation and the space and everything So obviously it s something that I had hoped for There s nothing like being alive in the now whenever it happens So I m happy about it It s such a beautiful building what a great space And when I m on the roof I can look over at my old apartment where I made some of that work So that s also very nostalgic but in a good way of nostalgic It s like there it is It s my history right there Kenny Scharf with Michael Alexander Gural Maiello on November Looking back on his array of subjects portraits of celebrities in his own universe seminal cartoon characters and plants and animal and glob creatures that he created Scharf encounters his own magnitude and prophecy When the Worlds Collide the Whitney s painting executed in is very big and very all encompassing And it s hard not to feel something when you re standing in front of it partly because of its size Scharf said of the monumental oil and acrylic spray paint on canvas that hangs more than feet high and nearly and a half feet wide That one was kind of groundbreaking in a way When thinking about how his past work influences his future work Scharf recalls Barbara Simpson s New Kitchen painted when he was a student at the University of California Santa Barbara UCSB Kenny Scharf Barbara Simpsons New Kitchen Acrylic on canvas x in Kenny Scharf Courtesy The Brant Foundation Greenwich CT I realized talking about it thinking about it that the content of that painting is the theme of all of my work It s like having this moment of your joy and ignoring the shit at the same time and that s kind of what that lady s doing and that s kind of what my characters are doing There s chaos going on and there s destruction and all this shit yet we re still alive And that s kind of how I feel all the time So I looked at that painting and I thought about it So I think I m making well I don t even want to reveal what I m going to do but I m doing something with that painting Installation view Kenny Scharf at The Brant Foundation On right wall When the Worlds Collide Whitney Museum of American Art New York purchase with funds from Edward R Downe Jr and Eric Fischl Recognizing the enduring timelessness of its content Scharf revisited his Judy Jetson on the Beach painting by creating a newer bigger better version in There s this couple at the beach They re not even enjoying the beach They re watching TV which is kind of predicting seeing people at the beach on their phones quipped Scharf It drives me crazy when people are at the beach and they re on their phones In the painting they re watching some show spiral They re hypnotized just like people on their phones Meanwhile the earth just had a bomb exploding on the horizon So it s about the same thing It s always the same thing It doesn t matter I m watching this show It seems more relevant than ever to me And I don t like to do that always be the doom and gloom But will someone please listen to me

art,This video can not be played Champions League highlights Aston Villa Celtic Celtic s enthralling defeat at Aston Villa was a near perfect illustration of the club s gripping and ultimately successful Champions League campaign A campaign which now rolls on to a tantalising two legged play off against either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in less than two weeks In Birmingham there were shades of the Borussia Dortmund horror show as Villa scored twice in the opening five minutes while missing a host of other chances Celtic players looked stunned and cowed in a raucous stadium against an elite side But as those memories of the Westfalenstadion on matchday two banished by recent improvements at Europe s top table came rushing back Celtic dug deep There was some of the fight and character shown in digging out a point at Atalanta and coming from behind to draw with Club Brugge as they steadied Then some of the swashbuckling stuff seen against RB Leipzig and Slovan Bratislava as Adam Idah ended his goal drought with a double to level That got Celtic right back in the contest which gripped until Morgan Rogers completed his hat trick to make it in stoppage time as the pressure from Villa proved too much in the second half Even in disappointment the Celtic players and fans both drained from another epic night left Villa Park knowing the story is not over They get to do it all again in the play off round against a European giant with the draw made on Friday That was the aim but now they re there Brendan Rodgers and his players will want to make the most of it Celtic can make it difficult for Bayern or Real Villa v Celtic reaction as it happened Visit our Celtic page for all the latest news analysis and fan views While Celtic s fightback and competitiveness was admirable the defeat was a reminder of the unforgiveable nature of playing the best in the Champions League Villa scored four missed a penalty hit a post had one cleared off the line racking up a hefty expected goals rating of Celtic played on the edge of chaos as they pressed and tried to move the ball quickly At times it worked but there were also a lot of mistakes Celtic conceded a lot of chances against Aston Villa They were caught in possession trying to play out from the back for Villa s second And Liam Scales was punished ruthlessly for pushing too high up the pitch for the third as Villa easily broke through on the counter Auston Trusty erratically slid in to give away a penalty while a poor header from the American in the first half lead to Jacob Ramsey hitting a post Young defender Dane Murray only recently returned from Queen s Park was robbed in his own box for the fourth in stoppage time There were plenty more moments when Celtic got themselves into trouble Without their best centre back Cameron Carter Vickers it was always going to be a tough task defensively while Daizen Maeda s defensive output was missed as Villa got joy down the flanks in the first half Maeda will miss the first leg of the next round due to suspension and with Kyogo Furuhashi away to Rennes and left back Alex Valle joining him out the door the last few days of the transfer window are big for the club With Real or Bayern coming to town they need to make sure they are as strong as possible from back to front Dortmund aside Celtic have been competitive and adaptable throughout this campaign and reaching the play off round is just rewards for that This video can not be played Idah scores double to draw Celtic level In the week Celtic lost talismanic striker Kyogo Idah provided a timely reminder of his capabilities to some of the more angst ridden among the club s fans That could be the biggest positive to come from this defeat The Irishman s two goals the first Villa had conceded on their own patch in the Champions League not only hauled his team back level from a bleak position but demonstrated his finishing abilities to many who had forgotten he had them The final goal in a home win against Ross County at the end of November was the last time the Irishman found the net before Wednesday BVP before Villa Park might become the reference point in Idah s Celtic career if he can kick on from this and fill Kyogo s substantial shoes The hope for Rodgers is Idah s instinctive finishes particularly for the first goal where he managed to react brilliantly to get his leg in a difficult position to lash home will spark something There were also glimpses of his running power in behind particularly one moment in the second half when he sprinted in behind and got a strike away Rodgers said afterwards it will be big for his confidence and this campaign has been a boost for Celtic s overall esteem on the grandest stage in club football Their progress was epitomised by their first half fightback in Birmingham They have nothing to lose from here on but the next challenge is to make sure the pride they have worked so hard to restore remains intact

art,Jeff Hamada For our first ever Booooooom Illustration Awards supported by Format we selected winners one for each of the following categories Editorial Personal Product Packaging Advertising Promotional Student Now it is our pleasure to introduce the winner of the Editorial category Hoi Chan Hoi Chan is an illustrator from Hong Kong currently based in New Orleans His winning illustration is an image he created for The New York Times The Beauty of a Silent Walk Art director Sarah Williamson A huge thank you to Format for supporting our awards this year Format is an online portfolio builder specializing in the needs of photographers artists and designers With nearly professionally designed website templates and thousands of design variables you can showcase your work your way with no coding required To learn more about Format check out their website here or start a day free trial We had the opportunity to ask Hoi some questions about his work enjoy the interview below Jeff Hamada What was the first piece of art you saw when you were younger that actually stuck with you Hoi Chan I can t really pinpoint a particular piece but I remember discovering Jimmy Liao s books When the Moon Forgot The Blue Stone The Sound of Colors when I was a child They opened up a whole new world for me about what illustration is and what it could be All of the characters in his books feel melancholy full of story but also very quiet which I think has influenced my own illustration practice Describe an artwork that you currently have displayed in your home Who made it what does it look like and what do you like about it I have a piece displayed in my living room created by Shunshun a Japanese artist who only uses blue ballpoint pens for his drawings I visited his studio in Japan in and commissioned him to create this piece for me He uses infinitely beautiful curved lines to depict wind and light and it calms my mind every time I see it Who are your biggest creative influences currently Daisuke Igarashi is definitely my biggest creative influence recently I love his work so much that I have to avoid looking at it too often so my own work doesn t end up being too influenced by it The level of detail in his work is astonishing and I love how he depicts nature and uses clever compositions I pull up his work once in a while to remind myself what art can be and it always pushes me to reach for another level I also had the honor of studying under a Tibetan thangka painting master Pema Rinzin when I was younger The dedication he has to his work and the techniques he taught me still have a big influence on me That s why some of my abstract symbols and shapes have a bit of Buddhist influence How would you describe your aesthetic to someone who has never seen your work Quiet distilled but abundant Can you share a bit about the process of creating your winning image from the initial seed of the idea to the final version I ve always loved working on assignments for The New York Times Wellness section For this image art director Sarah Williamson shared an article titled The Beauty of a Silent Walk with me I started by brainstorming jotting down words and doodling ideas to spark inspiration The sound of raindrops felt meditative and resonated with the tone of the article so I developed a few concepts and sketches around that Working with Sarah is always a pleasure because she gives such great direction throughout the process We worked together to refine the concepts until we landed on the final version It really felt like a team effort What s something Sarah might say to guide an idea or encourage further exploration that you ve found particularly helpful In my editorial illustration practice I focus on taking an abstract approach and pushing concepts further rather than being literal In the early stages Sarah and I worked closely together and she provided guidance on refining and adjusting my concepts to better connect with readers as well as suggesting additional elements This collaboration was helpful in balancing artistic expression with effectively conveying the editorial concept Where do you feel you are at in your creative journey Even though I ve been working as an illustrator for about five years I still feel like I m just getting started I think it s because I m always experimenting trying out new techniques and expanding my visual vocabulary There s still so much to explore and that keeps me excited and motivated What s one piece of good advice someone gave you and who said it Roman Muradov once said Look for inspiration from non visual mediums like literature and music it helps keep your work unique I heard this in one of his classes and it really stuck with me What is the most interesting thing you ve seen heard or experienced recently I recently visited the Big Island of Hawaii and stayed in the volcano area for a week It was an amazing experience to be surrounded by such a lush and ancient cloud forest I spent my time taking walks and just observing the little details of flowers rain and moss At night walking on the hardened lava I imagined molten lava flowing beneath the earth it was a surreal experience What is one thing you want to accomplish this next year In the coming year I d like to take some time to develop more personal work and maybe create some animations Last year I created two pieces called Bioluminescence where I explored the vulnerable side of human nature I really enjoyed diving into those subtle emotional themes and would love to expand on them by creating a series What is one thing you hope to accomplish in your lifetime I would love to create books and produce animated shorts during my lifetime Hoi Chan s Website Hoi Chan on Instagram Featuring the work

art,The Florida Highwaymen were a group of loosely affiliated mostly self taught Black painters men and one woman Mary Ann Carroll in the original group Willie Daniels Florida Backcountry n d Oil on Upson board x in Roger Lightle Collection What version of Florida do you see in the artwork of the Florida Highwaymen The idyllic sun drenched wind swept Florida beaches they painted or the segregated violently anti Black Florida they worked in Before Florida was Disney and the state and tourism industry effectively disconnected it in the American consciousness from the Jim Crow South the Sunshine State was home to the nation s first Civil Rights martyrs To race massacres To America s most evil sheriff To St Augustine a place referred to by Martin Luther King Jr in as the most lawless city I ve ever been in adding I ve never seen this kind of wide open violence St Augustine where a bigoted motel owner pouring acid on African American swimmers attempting to integrate his pool appeared across the front pages of the nation s newspapers finally ending the congressional filibuster of the Civil Rights Act Perhaps the reason behind the Florida Highwaymen s enduring legacy the group s increasing popularity in fact is whatever version of the state you want to see you can find it in their paintings Alfred Hair Rio Mar n d Oil on Canvas x Walker Collection The Florida Highwaymen were a group of loosely affiliated mostly self taught Black painters Twenty five men and one woman Mary Ann Carroll comprised the original group The Highwaymen worked along the state s Atlantic Coast from an epicenter in Fort Pierce one town south of Vero Beach beginning in the late s through about the peak years Their Fruit Loop colored sunsets beaches poinciana trees and Everglades back country landscape paintings fixed a Florida as tropical paradise image of the state into the minds of millions of residents and tourists That s because almost everyone who visited the state in the last half of the th century for any amount of time saw a Florida Highwaymen painting whether they realized it or not The Florida Highwaymen were volume painters sometimes creating or more paintings in a day They worked fast because they had to sell cheap No one in mid century Florida was willing to spend much money on a painting from a Black person The Florida Highwaymen were painting to pay bills so they sold artworks for a pop They sold a lot Do the math Twenty six artists creating multiple paintings a day for thirty years No precise accounting is possible but conservative estimates place the number of original Highwaymen paintings at around They filled the diners dentist offices hotel rooms and living rooms of the state s exploding population Their heyday coincided with a population boom predating consumers being able to buy cheap decorative art at places like Michael s or Home Goods If you wanted a nice landscape painting of the beach something x framed to go behind the secretary s desk or over the couch there were the Highwaymen They sold their paintings sometimes still with wet paint out of their car trunks up and down U S Highway direct to consumer They made the art and sold the art White owned galleries wanted nothing to do with them so they hit the highway hence the Highwaymen nickname although that didn t come until the s That doesn t mean original Florida Highwaymen paintings are easy to find Because they sold cheaply they were not valued as precious Thousands have been tossed out as children cleared their retired and deceased parents homes Thousands more lost to the Florida humidity Harold Newton Sister Pines at Sunset c Oil on Masonite x in Bruce Fraser Collection Each February the A E Backus Museum Gallery in Fort Pierce hosts a Highwaymen Weekend Celebration Backus was a successful professional fine art painter one of the state s first also based in Fort Pierce He was white While Backus only gave formal instruction to one member of the Florida Highwaymen Alfred Hair to many of the others he provided support ranging from a place to spend the night to cheap art supplies and moral support That was more radical in the s than it sounds today Then most white residents of Florida only allowed Black people to enter their homes through the back door and would never be caught socializing with them Most importantly Backus offered a proven business model If he could make a living selling landscape paintings of Florida why can t we the Highwaymen thought It beats broiling in the citrus fields picking oranges The highlight of Highwaymen Weekend takes place on the museum s Outdoor Mural Plaza where visitors seeking to start or build their personal collections of Highwaymen paintings can browse an impressive selection of vintage works of these artists offered for purchase It s a great opportunity for people who have heard about these artists or who are just getting to know these artists or wanting to know what all the fuss is about to come and get the full view J Marshall Adams Executive Director at the A E Backus Museum Gallery told Forbes com They can see the art in a museum context see why it s important They can learn the stories of these artists and the art and why this movement has been the phenomenon that it continues to be Then if they re interested in purchasing a work of art we have the vendors outside who for that weekend are selling original vintage Florida Highwaymen paintings Also on hand will be a professional independent art appraiser and an art conservator offering advice and insight into authentication pricing and care of original Highwaymen paintings Admission to the museum and vendor booths are free during the Highwaymen Weekend Celebration The City of Fort Pierce gets in on the fun as well with its th Annual Highwaymen Heritage Trail Art Show and Festival Saturday February from AM to PM at Moore s Creek Linear Park N th Street at the corner of Avenue D and th Street in Fort Pierce The event features original and second generation Highwaymen artists guided trail tours food and craft vendors music and more If any of the few remaining living original Highwaymen painters make it to Fort Pierce for the weekend this is where they re likely to be As part of the Festival the City is also organizing a bus tour of the Highwaymen Heritage Trail advance registration is required and space is limited Harold Newton Seascape c Oil on Upson board x in Collection of the A E Backus Museum Gallery H OB The Backus Museum simultaneously presents Florida Highwaymen at the Crossroads the latest in its annual series celebrating and exploring the national sensation that began in little Fort Pierce The presentation examines the lesser known history and events shaping the group s journey More than spectacular original Highwaymen paintings are on view drawn together from private collections around the state During Highwaymen weekend gallery presentations of the Highwaymen exhibition will be offered at AM and PM on Friday and Saturday and PM and PM on Sunday As a Florida story a Black History story a folk art story an American art story the numerous entry points into the Florida Highwaymen extend the group s appeal Some people really respond to these artists who somewhere inside each of them understood that they had artistic skill but didn t have the means to go on a regular path but worked around the obstacles They knocked on Backus door or they saw their neighbors painting or they were classmates or siblings of the artists and they just kind of had that encouragement to explore it without a formal teacher or a program or school Adams said People like the entrepreneurial aspect of it that these artists figured out they were being their own boss and could create this beautiful product that could go as far as the road would take them to find customers who would appreciate them and they certainly did Most of those customers then and many Highwaymen devotees today wouldn t consider themselves art collectors Maybe not even art lovers So many non art people they re attracted to it and it can be an entry point for them into art Adams said It s representative They recognize it Some people see a painting of what they call a fire sky composition really vivid reds and oranges of a sunset facing west and people say Oh I ve seen that before and they recognize that it s their first step maybe they go further or maybe they just can t get enough of the Highwaymen that s fine One Community Many Voices Create a free account to share your

art,Castlevania Nocturne returns with its second season on Netflix sparking online discussions about video game references animation enthusiasts sharing their favorite action clips and Alucard babygirl posts in its wake However a new season also brings the resurgence of pearl clutching and Gamergate adjacent rhetoric concerning Black representation which should be celebrated in the Powerhouse Animation series instead To address and preempt criticisms from those who deride the inclusion of Black characters in the video game series as woke we talked to Black Castlevania Nocturne writers Testament and Zodwa Nyoni and executive producer Clive Bradley about how they enriched Konami s fantastical source material setting with real world events and the Black experience This interview has been edited for length Isaiah Colbert io Castlevania is a series rich with fully realized characters especially when it comes to its Black characters We ve seen this in the past with characters like Isaac and now we re witnessing it again with Annette Edouard and Drolta While fans have come to expect Eurocentric historical events like the French Revolution to coincide with a fantastical story like Nocturne s the show surprised folks the world over by focusing on Black revolutions as well What inspired the idea of adding that element to Nocturne s story Clive Bradley Once we had the setting of the French Revolution which came from Rondo of Blood being set in it was vital I think to find some way to include the Haitian Revolution The most radical thing the French Revolution did was abolish slavery but the fundamental reason for that was that enslaved people were abolishing it themselves in the French colony of Saint Domingue later Haiti Of course then you need characters to dramatize this And having a relationship between one of these characters and the hero of the game Richter seemed an obvious choice Of course the next step was to build a writers room with writers who could help flesh this out I m so honored to have found Testament Zodwa and Temi Oh who did such a marvelous job Nyoni What I found interesting was that conversation about where the line between fiction and reality is I m a history buff I love politics and research so I loved the idea of leaning in on the work that I already do as an academic or as a writer in theater or screen but also meeting the world of Castlevania Myself Temi and Testament came on board to realize this vision that allowed us to not only bring ourselves and our cultural backgrounds to it but also open up the space for more research Testament What I like about working with Zodwa and Temi is that certain go to cliches have been used in portrayals of global majority heritage characters and we wanted to be real We ve seen those hairstyles a bunch and they re not historically accurate We can be fresh with that and keep it in history The Haitian Revolution again had famous women who were generals leaders and warriors like Marie Jeanne Lamartini re Victoria Montou aka Toya and Suzanne B lair It s just history Ten years ago we weren t talking about it until people went back and gone Oh yeah C cile Fatiman was doing spells in the woods and then going and fighting plantation owners That s a real true life story she wasn t the only woman A bunch of women were in leadership doing that so we re just drawing on real things putting it into our fantasy and hopefully continuing that tradition of mashing together historical periods dope animation and representing it io What was your guiding principle for enriching Nocturne s Black characters with mythological elements tied to African culture and real life events like chattel slavery and the Haitian Revolution Nyoni We were fortunate throughout the process to work with a Haitian American scholar called C cile Accilien Much of her work revolved around Francophone studies so she gave us cultural and historical context That specificity was significant for us to think about how we accurately represented the Haitian Revolution and found space for creative license We spent so much time cultivating and finding points of accuracy and even conversing with Netflix about the choice of language what to label accurately Those things were important for us in the process Testament The first season was so much about freedom There s a continual theme about people finding and fighting for freedom in different ways Thematically it just made sense History has always been viewed through a particular lens certain characters have fallen by the wayside Thomas Alexandre Dumas Alexandre Dumas father was this war hero in charge of one of the biggest armies in the French Revolution There are people like Chevalier Saint George who mentored him but this has been erased from history It was people like Napoleon who brought back slavery after the French Revolution got rid of it had beef with Thomas Alexandre Dumas and tried to leave the black guy in prison I m half African heritage and half European in my bloodline I have slave owners on my African side and on my European side slaves and oppressed I m passionate about hearing different sides of the human experience and that s what great art can do We can have a platform for different stories but not just for the sake of it to push the narrative forward Being historically accurate you re gonna see some Black faces and Black stories pop up so we wanted it to be authentic and not just people put it in there for the sake of it io Were there any elements vital to you for Nocturne to nail in the writers room regarding Black representation Zyoni Everything felt vital Being able to go back and have conversations with the directors and the animators about hair texture clothing and cultural research on why certain characters have specific clothing and facial features We did all of that work because representation felt important to us When you start thinking about where we jumped to in time there s no way we can land in in Haiti suddenly with way more Black characters and not do the work and create a series that felt true to research io There have always been clich s for how Black characters are represented in animation Whether it s how hair isn t quite right or how if Black character is a monster it s leaning on stereotypes that aren t kosher What was the collaborative process between the animation team and the writers over how characters should look in the show Nyoni I remember conversing about the evolution of Annette s hair They drew up different hairstyles studied the meaning behind getting the hair texture accurate and then went back and looked at images We can t be doing all this contextual research around world building but not go back and look at what these characters look like At one point I was going The shape of the nose isn t right You can t do this copy and paste thing of the same physical features but then just make everybody shades of brown It just isn t going to work So we sat down and talked a lot about why that mattered I think what was really great is the team was always open to those conversations and understanding Representation isn t just about whether or not are we using the right language It s also about what is it we visually see I really appreciate being included in those kinds of conversations because it meant this idea around representation had a through line across the board I hate it when you watch shows and you go Oh they got that element right but they completely didn t pay attention to this thing here It s also to do with the length of time it takes to create this series You have more space to have those conversations It helps to have a receptive team that wants to hear why those things are necessary as opposed to trying to cut corners io Nyoni as the writer of Annette s breakout episode in season one what was your reaction to the response Nyoni When we were talking about which episodes everybody wanted to write I was always drawn to Annette I wanted to write an origin episode and think about where she comes from her family s background and the connection to her spirituality ancestors deities and Orishas It s been lovely seeing spaces where Annette is embraced and celebrated People love how badass and complex she is but also seeing how people discuss Annette in relation to the games and the expectations of Black characters whether or not it s about their visibility or in spaces where they ve decided that Black folks shouldn t be visible It s interesting thinking about how people pick at this idea of Blackness visibility or representation in fictional spaces and whether or not we re having multiple conversations within this show We need to be able to go What s the thing that we re saying about fictional stories What s the thing that we re saying about adaptations What s the thing that we re saying about blackness and visibility But sometimes it feels like all this stuff got enmeshed into one and exposed people s prejudice and racial biases I ve always been massively proud of Annette as a character It felt like such a privilege to write her and see people s reactions to the depiction of voodoo and Orishas and loving it io There s a scene in season two where Richter and Annette discuss Henry the Last s execution allyship the consequences of revolutions and those who symbolize authority meeting their end right or wrong How important was keeping that prescient revolution theme ongoing while having characters converse without talking down to each other Nyoni When people start revolutions they are determined to challenge the institutions that no longer serve them Having characters like Annette as the voice of that change we re doing it on different levels where we can tackle the meaning purpose and desire for the Haitian Revolution Inevitably we have this dynamic with levels of protagonist and antagonist whether or not it s in the context of Castlevania or the world we live in You ve got to find your people and organize to effect change We see this at the top of the series when Annette seeks out the Belmonts You constantly have to find your tribe of people who are also invested in this change that you want to bring about We cannot do it alone This idea that revolutions and civil rights movements happen and everything is done is not true because society is a living breathing thing constantly organizing What I really liked about the way we edited season one is that sometimes you get this idea that everything s tied up nicely in a bow and you re done But the fight continues and I think it will continue regardless of whether we re in a season three four or five The fight doesn t just begin or end with you Characters like Annette must return to their ancestors for that internal strength and rich conversation around revolution In the African context you re not fighting alone with those alive You re also doing it with the living dead their answers never leave you and are part of your strength in the fight Testament What I love about our writers room is that we ve all got slightly different political nuances and none of us want to dumb down For example the church was sending Trevor to fight vampires whereas in the Castlevania Netflix series the Church instigated the whole crisis in the first place Texture layers and history are fused within that love for the game I am a person of faith hence Testament My issues with organized religion are real and the conversation between Maria and the Abbott in episode seven of season one is a grown up conversation No one is entirely right or entirely wrong Maria is generally more right than her crazy corrupt dad Still he s got some points and they re having an honest theological debate We still want it to be sensational and spectacle with crazy battles and fantastic animation Still it s a grown up show with beauty and nuance that we try to put into a minute episode which is ambitious When dealing with nuance some people will get it and some people will not but it s all in there io What was your favorite character moment in Castlevania Nocturne that you had a hand in writing and why Testament Drolta is one of my favorite characters Even before we d written the dialogue and saw the design for her I was like This is the person I want to go for drinks with In my episode we get to see a bit of her backstory and why she is the way she is which ties back to her African heritage via the Nubians in Egypt the different cults and different religions within Egypt at the time I was talking to Egyptologists at Manchester University about you know what they would have used and what the ceremony would have been Of course we have some dramatic licenses but we take them seriously We still have this British sensibility that sort of irony and dryness from the first and fourth seasons Although Temi is of Nigerian heritage Zodwa is Zimbabwean I m half English half Ghanaian we ve fully grown up in schools and education and a culture of very dry humor snarkiness sarcasm and nerdiness That spans a singular race To honor the Haitian Revolution which was the only fully successful slave uprising for a whole nation was a monumental moment all the world paid attention to it at the time and the French empire got a bloody nose from that Nyoni We talk a lot about spirituality and Annette s connection with her ancestors in the first season but by the time we get to the second season we re not able to delve into that world because up to this point so much of kind of her access has always been through C cile Fatiman Now there s so much growth within her and her powers that we can see how she transports herself into other realms and assists the team in fighting Erzsabet in unexpected ways io There s been a rise in the gaming zeitgeist that coincides with the entertainment industry where stories centering on Black characters are deemed woke and pejorative For Nocturne specifically a small minority of the viewing audience scoffed at the swapping of Annette accusing the series of not remaining faithful to the games as Blackwashing or forced inclusivity for a Black quota As a writer what s your reaction to the discourse that routinely sounds off whenever a Black character is highlighted in a show Bradley Richter s girlfriend in the game is Annette which is a French name so we used that name It certainly wasn t because of some supposed need for a quota of Black characters Netflix never said anything about that It flowed from the logic of the story we wanted to tell A minority of the audience have attacked the show as woke and so forth Of course on one level that was to be expected But it s quite disturbing to be honest that some people see the element of the story which is at core slavery is bad freedom is good as controversial or simplistic or something and woke I think maybe some people haven t grasped that the Haitian Revolution was a real thing that actually happened which most people don t know about If it s woke to tell a story which is partly about that well so be it Testament I think all conversation is welcome as long as we aren t shutting down conversation on whatever side I think it s an opportunity to talk about how the French Revolution had important Black people When the new politics of the revolution was starting you had freed slaves in parliament The first Black representative was in Paris during that era There was a Black area of Paris at that time That s real stuff Even going back to that famous conversation between Richter and Dracula in the games they talk about slavery and religion Richter asks Dracula You wanna enslave all men s souls This freedom narrative for Richter goes back to the games all we re doing is adding to that Hopefully taking limited characters like Annette who in the computer games has purple hair and is a damsel in distress originally that hasn t got many lines or much of a story arc it s like Please save me Richter I believe in you Richter That s her story arc Annette starts at a different place but grows to believe in Richter She isn t a damsel in distress but can handle her own as women in that period did historically We just conveniently forget about it sometimes Richter is still the hero still kicks butt and takes names He s flawed he s on a journey To start with him was like Arnold Schwarzenegger didn t make sense for us He s still the main dude he has strong supporting friends Nyoni It s interesting when you think about these perceived white spaces that Black characters and people are not supposed to exist in Historically Black folks have been around in spaces where white people think that we have not been We have long rooted histories in spaces You end up with this outcry about Blackwashing and you go What s the thing that you are actually afraid of When we go back to the series there is this evolution of characterization with what do you do with Annette from the game to the TV series Where do adaptations sit What space are they allowed to occupy Nobody s stopping you from playing the games There s something really interesting and creative we re doing with the series that allowed us to end up with this character with a Haitian background that looked back to Yor b We were able to create a character that felt more relevant to the space and world that we had built and I think it would have been just so massively incomprehensible to have landed during the kind of Haitian revolution without showing that vastness of Blackness culture religion and meaningful representation In popular culture when it comes to the representation of people of color I think it is crucial and there is nothing about the existence of Annette that I regret I am so proud of that character and I m so proud of the work that has gone in not only with myself but with the writing team as a whole that we ve done in her narrative thread in the world we built together Somebody else s prejudice and racism are not for me to tackle I just have to continue to write great stories That is my only task io What impact do you hope Castlevania Nocturne s story will have on the gaming and animation industry Nyoni When the first series came out we saw the impact in real time Once the series had been out for a while we started to see cosplay and go Oh snap people are embodying the idea you had of all these characters It is exciting to have more spaces where you can find new writers and writers can find themselves But it takes showrunners like Bradley to say I need new voices in the space Showrunners and producers have to work to bring those voices in otherwise where do we find that entry point I don t know how else I would have gotten here if they hadn t requested different voices in the space Testament The power of stories to share different experiences with our love of video games and culture When I grew up there weren t heroes who looked like me so we had Bruce Lee There were some athletes but in terms of the animated space and the anime space you had Kaneda he was my guy but he didn t look like me I love Akira and everything it says about government and how we live our lives You can have a cool motorbike chase but you can also think about what totalitarian states are Castlevania Nocturne has a great opportunity to have conversations and to discuss things that don t typically get discussed My favorite art gives me sensation and emotion but also might leave me

stuck with you Jess Martinez It was a book I had when I was a toddler It s actually one of my earliest memories and I was probably or years old The book was The Tale of Peter Rabbit I loved the light washes of color the gentle tones and the cute animals It really stuck with me I think it s one of the reasons I gravitated toward nature a lot as a kid and it continued to influence me well into my adult life Describe an artwork that you currently have displayed in your home Who made it what does it look like and what do you like about it The Accolade by Edmund Blair Leighton is a painting my parents have hung in our home for over years Obviously it s not an original painting but one of the many pre Raphaelite works we have displayed alongside impressionist landscape pieces It portrays a noblewoman knighting a man who is on his knees I always found the lighting and the overall theme very interesting as a kid On summer days when the weather was so hot that the power would go out I d spend hours analyzing the sparkle of the chainmail or the golden threads on her dress I guess I like it for a multitude of reasons the strongest one being nostalgia Who are your biggest creative influences currently Lately I m on a journey to strengthen my skills in gouache painting techniques so I m very influenced by Hayao Miyazaki and his use of gouache and poster colors I saw his paintings when they were on display at the Academy Museum and I m actively trying to replicate the liveliness I saw in his brushstrokes with my own work How would you describe your aesthetic to someone who has never seen your work My aesthetic blends feminine forward designs with a touch of melancholy often drawing inspiration from botanical elements It s a balance of delicate colors moody subjects and emotional depth I like to think my work feels both intimate and universally resonant combining vintage and contemporary details Can you share a bit about the process of creating your winning image from the initial seed of the idea to the final version The winning image is named Morning Glory She s part of a series inspired by Georgian jewelry I wanted to create something that incorporated the old and the new so I designed ornate earrings on a subject with a botanical twist I wanted her to feel delicate intricate and beautiful just like a morning glory Where do you feel you are at in your creative journey I feel like I haven t really started yet if I m honest How I feel could best be described as being in my chrysalis phase After so much learning and practice I m now implementing what I know into the real world I feel like I m desperately trying to burst out of my cocoon but I m not quite ready yet I think that s where I m at What s one piece of good advice someone gave you and who said it The best tool you have is to observe is something one of my professors Brian Rea said in a class Always observe keep things simple and never stop being curious these are great pieces of advice I ve received over the years from multiple people I d say those three things are important to never forget What is the most interesting thing you ve seen heard or experienced recently The Boy and the Heron is a Studio Ghibli film that is confusing complex and full of emotion I rewatched it recently and it made more sense after watching it from a different viewpoint It s a beautifully perplexing movie that s been inspiring me lately What is one thing you want to accomplish this next year I want to create more I hope to have the ability to properly translate my thoughts into brushstrokes I m getting close but haven t quite cracked it yet I m planning to close that gap next year What is one thing you hope to accomplish in your lifetime I hope to inspire people the way I ve been inspired by others Jess Martinez s Website Jess Martinez on Instagram Featuring the work of fine artists and illustrators tomorrow s Talent is now officially available

art,People have left everything from portraits of their dead dog to a spiteful mystery box Art galleries and museums build their collections in a number of different ways One of these lies in the form of bequests that are left to the institutions after people s deaths People will donate artwork objects and even money that enables the institution of their choice to purchase more items But sometimes museums and galleries wind up receiving something odd or something fairly normal but with strange stipulations attached Here s a look at some unusual bequests that have been left to art galleries and museums over the past couple of centuries The Smithsonian Institution was named after British chemist named James Smithson the man who made its existence possible Smithson didn t have any kids to leave his fortune to and decided that should his nephew die without fathering children all of his wealth would instead go to the United States despite the fact that he had never even visited the country The gift was controversial at the time and a number of American figures allegedly resented Smithson s patronage particularly given the history between Britain and the U S But the bequest was ultimately accepted and the Smithsonian Institution institute continues to thrive today Francis Douce was a curator at the British Museum in London for four years before resigning in due to a number of issues all of which he detailed in an angry letter to the institution Douce died in and left most of his papers to the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford but did ask that one box be given to the British Museum That particular box came with an unusual stipulation It could only be opened in which was years after Douce s death The museum s trustees agreed to this strange condition When the box was finally opened as stipulated a number of contemporary newspaper reports stated it contained among debris a note saying Douce would never leave the museum anything of value other accounts dispute the presence of a note Whatever the contents the former curator had the last laugh by making the museum wait so long to know what if anything was inside the box The art collector Henry Vaughan was an avid admirer of the painter J M W Turner He collected many of the watercolor paintings the artist had created during his travels around Europe After Vaughan s death in the collector left a large number of bequests to art galleries in Britain and Ireland He gave watercolor paintings to the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin and another to the National Gallery in Edinburgh but on the understanding that they only be publicly exhibited in January each year Vaughan thought the lack of strong light during this month would be the best conditions to prevent the colors in the paintings from fading He also insisted that these January exhibitions be free of charge to the public both galleries continue to honor this with free annual Turner in January exhibitions still held in Dublin and Edinburgh In the National Gallery in Edinburgh received unexpected news when they learned that a wealthy engineer and philanthropist named James Cowan Smith had left them a very generous bequest the equivalent of around million almost million today which was to be used to purchase artwork for its collections The bequest had two conditions that were related to Cowan Smith s dogs both Dandie Dinmont terriers one was that a sum of money be allocated to looking after his surviving dog Fury and the other that a portrait of his deceased dog Callum by the artist John Emms be permanently hung on the walls Callum s portrait is still displayed at the gallery Rather than donating someone else s artwork Marcel Duchamp left a piece he had created but stipulated that it could only be unveiled after his death Not only had the work never been seen before but most people had no idea it even existed and wrongly thought Duchamp had abandoned art in his later years tant donn s an installation that could only be viewed through eyeholes on a door was his final work Duchamp left detailed instructions on how his bequest was to be constructed and exhibited with the secrecy and surprise acting as part of his final artistic statement The Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired the piece and began displaying it in just one year after Duchamp died The writer Eli Leon left almost quilts made by Black quiltmakers to the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive in California after his death in Leon had helped to bring more attention to the creations of quiltmaker Rosie Lee Tompkins he wanted to ensure this kind of work would be equally valued alongside other forms of art The museum is due to host a new exhibition of them from June to November Read More About Art Minute Media All Rights Reserved,0.695,positive
art,Tourists hoping to spot the most famous painting in the world will likely have a much shorter wait French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the Louvre will undergo extensive renovations including a new room for the Mona Lisa The painting will be installed in a special space accessible independently of the rest of the museum Macron said while standing in the Mona Lisa s current gallery The museum will also get new entrances and underground gallery spaces among other improvements The renovations which will likely cost millions will be partially financed by increasing ticket fees for non European Union citizens beginning in The Louvre currently displays Leonardo Da Vinci s masterpiece in a gallery with several other paintings like The Wedding Feast at Cana by Paolo Veronese For years both tourists and art enthusiasts have raised objections to the painting s placement An estimated of Louvre guests visit the museum specifically to see the Mona Lisa overcrowding the gallery taking selfies and disregarding the surrounding artworks One critic referred to the Mona Lisa as the Kim Kardashian of th century Italian portraiture in a New York Times op ed pleading for the painting to receive its own space The already frustrating situation reached an apparent crisis point this week when a leaked memo from the Louvre s director Laurence des Cars to Culture Minister Rachida Dati revealed a proliferation of damage to the museum s spaces some of which are in a very poor condition Des Cars wrote that parts of the museum are no longer watertight posing a risk to the art s safety She also characterized visiting the Louvre as a physical ordeal especially due to the nature of viewing the most famous painting in the world Adding to the museum s frustrations the Mona Lisa often eclipses the rest of the Louvre s collections Da Vinci s masterpiece is a work of art that appeals to the whole world she said As a result of this popularity the public flocks to the Salle des Etats without being given the means to understand the work and the artist thereby calling into question the museum s public service mission Our free fast and fun briefing on the global economy delivered every weekday morning,0.8455,positive

art,Last year I moved from New Jersey to Spain As much as I love my family being in the US stresses me out Instead of flying home I wanted to experience something new this holiday season that would hopefully be a salve to the constant political disappointment I ve been feeling as a Black woman living in the country Though Barcelona my current city comes alive during December with Christmas markets festive lights and a wave of tourists I was craving greenery the tranquility of nature and maybe a sprinkle of luxury at least for a few days I knew I d find that in Ireland which I ve loved every time I ve visited Less than a month before Christmas I did some last minute planning to make my dream trip a reality I ve been to Ireland a few times and multiple people I ve met abroad have encouraged me to visit West Cork The somewhat underrated foodie destination is covered in farmland and remnants of Ireland s once abundant temperate rainforests My curiosity was fully piqued so I booked an extended weekend at Liss Ard Estate in the town of Skibbereen The luxurious estate was a bit of a splurge for me the cheapest suites start at euros or about a night but I considered it a Christmas gift to myself I hoped to spend time in nature during my trip but I wasn t expecting to see greenery similar to that of Jurassic Park in the winter Irish countryside I spent most of my time in West Cork wandering the Irish Sky Garden which James Turrell created in the s I didn t even know about the internationally renowned masterpiece of interactive natural art when I booked my stay but it s safe to say I was forever changed by the beautiful installation The Sky Garden is basically just a giant concave oval When standing inside it the sounds of nature are amplified and the sky turns into a massive portrait As I lay on the rock slab staring at the sky and hearing blades of grass shuffle in the breeze I was reminded how wonderful it is to just be present in the moment I loved the solitude of West Cork but I planned on spending Christmas Day in Dublin more specifically at Jacobs Inn I ve stayed in this hostel every time I ve visited Dublin As an avid solo traveler I rarely find accommodations that organically create the feeling of family among strangers but this place does it for me every time Immediately after entering and putting my bags in storage I met a travel buddy at the bar who mildly peer pressured me into going to a reggaeton club something I didn t even know existed in Dublin We had a blast Though Dublin was crowded with a wave of holiday tourists and locals gathering with friends and family I was still able to carve out dedicated time to rest regroup and explore the city at my own pace Two of my favorite adventures were finding The Little Pig Speakeasy and visiting the city s museums The four properties of the National Museum of Ireland and the National Gallery are all free to the public so I took my time wandering through as many exhibits as I could The speakeasy was the most authentic feeling one I ve been to in years To enter my hostel buddy and I had to find a pay phone type three numbers say a code that we got from a local store owner enter a trick wall and then follow the neon pig The tasty cocktails were worth the effort we made getting into the bar Other than talking to my mom on Christmas Day everything about this holiday was new for me At times it was a bit overwhelming But not knowing what each day would bring during a season that s usually steeped in tradition was also exciting Whether I return to Ireland in December or set off to another country I m excited to make solo travel my new holiday tradition Jump to,0.9985,positive

curated lists of our favorite media check out What to Play and What to Watch After a dalliance with miniatures painting in high school I caught the bug again in with the launch of Warhammer s th edition Since then I ve painted dozens and dozens of miniatures and even had my work published on the official Games Workshop community website I m not a professional painter but I am a dedicated hobbyist with a penchant for trying out wacky new tools Here are the bits that I use on a weekly basis to make spending time with my little space boys more enjoyable Citadel s plastic cement is fine It s just fine It s thin enough to run when you need it to run and thick enough to stay put when you need it to stay put But if I have to take the plugged up microscopic metal pipette out one more time to clean it I m going to lose my mind That s why I opt instead for a two pronged approach from Tamiya which uses little brushes instead Tamiya Extra Thin Cement smells pretty bad not as bad as the quick drying variant but pretty bad Good news is that it s just the thing to get those tiny bits stuck together real good The low viscosity formula also means it s great at flowing into nooks and crannies I particularly love using it along the edges of two part cylinders like those found on tanks and artillery pieces It s also great for sealing the gaps in larger pieces especially when you slop it on from behind where no one will see the mess For larger joints and areas that are particularly well hidden I rely on regular Tamiya Cement It melts plastic a bit more aggressively than the thin stuff and its higher viscosity makes it great for covering larger areas without damaging fine details With a two bottle holder custom made to keep these weird shaped bottles upright on the table you ve got everything you need for plastic adhesives While lots of folks seem to like the Citadel nippers I ve had much better luck with the Tamiya Sharp Pointed Side Cutter Having used both tools I find the Citadel version to be overly large in the hand especially so for folks with smaller hands But most importantly Tamiya s much more slender cutting head makes for closer and more precise cuts right up against the model And more precise cuts means less time spent removing mold lines No matter how good your nippers are you will eventually have some mold lines that need removing especially if you re using an airbrush For cleaning models I m a big fan of the Citadel Mouldline Remover in addition to a hobby knife It s a great way to non destructively remove minute imperfections especially around curved areas Especially if you have bigger hands and bad eyes like I do it s an expeditious tool that can help you make fewer model ruining mistakes Add in some Micro Mark Softback Polishing Sticks and some even smaller and more flexible sanding twigs and you ve got everything you need to prep and dry fit your models While I ve already written extensively about my favorite paints and brushes I also love using a wet palette to keep my paints moist and mixable For the last months or so I ve been using the Exemplar Wet Palette from Game Envy and I can t say enough good things about it After years struggling with the Masterson Sta Wet Handy Palette I love the Exemplar for its rigid dishwasher safe construction It also creates a very tight seal that when combined with some pennies or the copper bits sold as add ons helps mitigate mold growth when I forget to clean out my palette between painting sessions Add in additional features like brush storage and a smartphone easel on the top and you have what I consider to be the premier wet palette for painting miniatures today Another must have accessory for me is the Paint Puck Rinse Cup brush cleaner While the silicone nubbins on the bottom are of questionable utility it s the arms up top that make this an important part of my setup They re a great way to hold your brush s tip pointing downward when you re not actively using it They also keep paint and other debris from infiltrating the ferrule which is the metal clamp that holds the hairs onto the brush Finally I simply would not be able to get as much done in one sitting without the Lab Genius Mini Vortex Mixer Originally designed for medical and research settings it is a rock solid option for mixing even the most stubborn thick paints The clever construction

Policy Cookie Policy Jenny Brewer Lucy Bourton Elizabeth Goodspeed Liz Gorny Olivia Hingley Ellis Tree Extra Search Account Blending biological and botanical influences the illustrator has developed an intricate new style making ethereal drawings that sit miles apart from his previous marks Since we last caught up with the visual artist Ramon Keimig in a lot has changed In fact the illustrator tells us I believe my practice has fundamentally transformed His work previously bursting with bright colour now takes to more natural hues Hard graphic outlines have become softly etched scratches Ethereal or perhaps more botanical in form these organic shapes and textures have become a focus of Ramon s printmaking his practice now navigating a space between fine art and illustration A big factor in this shift in the artist s individual style is his move from the city to the countryside Finding a new base near the Black Forest in the northwest of Germany Ramon has found a new rhythm for himself shaped by long walks in nature and introspective drawing sessions he says As a result my work has become more attuned to the raw and cosmic weaving together emotional intensity and subconscious impulses through more automatic drawing As opposed to seeing his practice as a separate isolated act from its setting Ramon sees it as something that is embedded in the ordinary taking its tips from the everyday I think I m super sensitive to my direct surroundings he says No wonder my work has changed Over the last five years alongside exhibitions and illustrating for editorial projects and magazines like Bloomberg or Die Ziet Ramon has spent a large part of his time delving into the world of music marking numerous album covers cassette covers and concert posters with his work In that time he also turned his attention to a masters degree in fine art with a focus on printmaking and drawing at the Institute of Art Gender and Nature IAGN in Basel building up an extensive archive of drawings and prints and developing my style to something very personal and organic he says Although his illustrations may have taken a dive into the natural and organic Ramon s process is still a mix of the analogue and digital Whilst a lot of his drawings start on paper with ink and pencil the artist goes through the process of printing them out on cheap recycled coloured or found paper to then scan each impression back in to explore further digital manipulations on screen Some of his lines also begin digitally with custom brushes and recorded actions he s stored up in photoshop to manipulate or expand his drawings When it comes to taking things into print Ramon likes to combine his digital lines with analog marks to create contrast making use of processes like Risograph for a grainy effect screen printing onto raw fabric for canvas based works and even printing with broken machines he says like a printer I found on the street with sticky ink All are ways to translate all the intricate patterns of his daily automatic drawings into the most unique textures the details of which are influenced by a range of biological references such as fossil like structures nervous system anatomy plant like forms as well as microscopic or macroscopic views of natural processes like decay and metamorphosis he explains Whilst almost everything has changed Ramon says that much of his current work still builds on my earlier work methods Certainly experimental and transcendent of strict categories the artist s practice is always focused on the constant development of an individual visual language in every form from surreal fantastical and architectural computer drawings fictive exhibition spaces and artworks autobiographical portraits to introspective to cosmic plant animal and insect motifs In sum the line he s following through all his drawings is a continuous appetite for discovery Ramon Keimig Canvas x cm Ramon Keimig Ramon Keimig

art,Andrew Limbong An architectural detail of the The Robert C Weaver Federal Building photographed in Washington D C in Mladen Antonov AFP via Getty Images hide caption Among his day one actions President Donald Trump addressed an issue he tried to tackle in his first term federal architecture Trump issued a memorandum directing the General Service Administration to advance policies that ensure federal public buildings respect regional traditional and classical architectural heritage in order to uplift and beautify public spaces and ennoble the United States and our system of self government What happened the first time Late into his first term Trump signed an executive order to promote neoclassical architecture as the official style for federal buildings in Washington D C and elsewhere The order specified that it was a push away from the often divisive brutalist architecture that was common for federal buildings built between the s and s The American Institute of Architects quickly criticized the executive order in a statement saying it inappropriately elevates the design tastes of a few federal appointees over the communities in which the buildings will be placed President Joe Biden revoked the order in February The US Federal Trade Commission building in Washington D C Paul J Richards AFP via Getty Images hide caption What s different now I think it s extraordinarily exciting that day one President Trump is planting the flag demonstrating that federal architecture is going to be a priority in this administration said Justin Shubow Shubow is president of the National Civic Art Society a Washington D C non profit that promotes classical traditions in architecture He is also the former chairman of the United States Commission of Fine Arts appointed by Trump during his first term The language in this new memorandum is softer than the language in Trump s executive order but Shubow said it stops the General Services Administration from approving any new buildings and it also provides time for the President to nominate a new administrator of the GSA The American Institute of Architects has responded in a statement saying the organization is extremely concerned about any revisions that remove control from local communities mandate official federal design preferences or otherwise hinder design freedom and add bureaucratic hurdles for federal buildings The group adds that it will continuously monitor the process laid out in the memo and provide feedback from AIA s over members comprising licensed practicing architects who live and work in every community across the country The J Edgar Hoover building in Washington D C Kent Nishimura Getty Images hide caption The GSA currently owns or leases properties across the United States Puerto Rico Guam and American Samoa One building that might be directly impacted by the memorandum is the FBI headquarters The famously brutalist J Edgar Hoover building has long been in need of repair Under Biden the decision was made to move the headquarters to Maryland But Trump has expressed interest in keeping the building in D C posting on Truth Social THE NEW FBI BUILDING SHOULD BE BUILT IN WASHINGTON D C NOT MARYLAND AND BE THE CENTERPIECE OF MY PLAN TO TOTALLY RENOVATE AND REBUILD OUR CAPITAL CITY INTO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SAFEST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD You put all that together and it seems likely that President Trump is going to want a classical new FBI building right on Pennsylvania Avenue America s Main Street said Shubow The United States Capitol in Washington D C Anna Rose Layden Getty Images hide caption According to Shubow classical architecture can incorporate all the latest in building technologies He said the style can be more sustainable too A traditional building is not disposable and can last hundreds of years Look at the Capitol building which is still functioning well he said Modernist architecture such as brutalism became the norm for federal buildings starting in Working for President John F Kennedy at the time Daniel Patrick Moynihan drafted a document called Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture It stated that the development of an official style must be avoided Design must flow from the architectural profession to the Government and not vice versa Angela Person cocurator of a brutalism exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington D C previously told NPR that architects were drawn to the style because of its lack of ornamentation I think it was a popular style in that time because there was this need to really rapidly scale up the amount of office space for the federal government Person said But as Trump orders federal workers to head back into the office don t expect all their buildings to start looking the same In the original executive order which said there should be special regard for traditional design traditional was defined very broadly said Shubow So for instance to include Pueblo revival Romanesque Mediterranean styles all sorts of different regional styles of historic architecture So it was never imposing pediment and columns across the land Jennifer Vanasco edited

art,Marija Canjuga December min Read Share Tamara de Lempicka Portrait de Marjorie Ferry private collection Christie s Detail Tamara de Lempicka Estate LLC European Art Art History European Art Let s imagine a glamorous party in the s and our host is the grand Tamara de Lempicka We can hear jazz playing in the background and see flappers dancing everywhere Let s meet the famous personalities of the s who would most likely attend a party like this one First we should get to know our host She is picking us up in her green Bugatti wearing a leather helmet and gloves wrapped in a grey scarf waving in the wind De Lempicka is a famous Polish Art Deco painter of the s Writers fellow artists scientists and nobility want to be portrayed by her Her pale skin with that cold look and lubricious red lips show that she is aware of her position she is independent rich and inaccessible and she makes the rules Arriving at the party we meet De Lempicka s cousins Irene and Ludmilla Declair They are both wearing loose dresses Fashion for women in the s was all about getting loose Daywear had sleeves and straight pleated hanky hems or tiered skirts Day dresses had a drop waist which was a sash or belt worn low on the waist or hip with a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle up to the knee never above Jewelry was less relevant Bobbed hair was the most popular style giving a boyish look In addition the s was the time when society rejected the corset and Coco Chanel came up with her timeless little black dress Irene rolls back her eyes in a manner reminiscent of certain Baroque depictions of saints that witness the impact of classic art on De Lempicka s work What would be a s party without music That s why there in the corner of the room is a girl playing the guitar She has bobbed hair and is wearing a blue satin dress This is one of De Lempicka s portraits inspired by a traditional motif in fine arts allegorical representations of the arts Here music is depicted as a beautiful elegant and dark haired woman preoccupied with music As a matter of fact the Renaissance works that Lempicka saw in museums while traveling through Italy had a great influence on her work The light blue dress repels the usual drab palette of early Cubism Therefore in De Lempicka s paintings palettes are limited but the color rarely fades The colors she selects are in step with the tastes of the period Tamara de Lempicka Blue Woman with a Guitar private collection Christie s Tamara de Lempicka Estate LLC A party is always a good place to find out new stuff isn t it We notice two ladies whispering to each other They are very stylish both looking cute and elegant with their red hats and red lipstick cosmetics were associated with prostitution until the s This is also the decade when the role of women in society changed rapidly For example women gained the right to vote in most countries New careers opened for women in offices and schools with salaries that allowed them to be more independent A new kind of feminine lifestyle was born the flapper Flappers had short hair and wore make up and loose dresses ankle or knee length They danced drank and smoked Now we are going to meet one of the VIPs that De Lempicka portrayed Here is Duchesse de la Salle looking threatening in jackboots one hand tucked in her pocket Yes she is dressed like a man and no it wasn t forbidden then In the s homosexuality became more visible and somewhat more acceptable Humor was even used to help make it acceptable This work offers a new image of a modern woman with unrelenting self determination and unapologetic sexuality contradicting traditional portrayals of women viewed only as sexual objects The second VIP we are meeting at De Lempicka s s party is a real charmer Marquis d Afflitto in a confident half lying pose donning a suit with a bow tie looking at us with an arrogant gaze below his eyebrows He looks enormous and frightening with broad shoulders and a triangular torso A slick sharp man of the city In the s business suits were the day to day attire for men in white collar jobs Striped plaid or windowpane suits came in dark grey blue and brown in the winter and ivory white tan and pastels in the summer Shirts were white and neckties were essential Finally at De Lempicka s party we meet the super sexy but very sophisticated guest Joan Jeffery fiancee of oilman Rufus T Bush This masterpiece was lost for years Lempicka s women are modern sensual and fashionable female figures composed of characteristic generously modeled plans and forms of Cubism This contrasts sharply with Cubist compositions In Cubism subjects and backgrounds seem to be constantly changing and individual components of the overall work are equally important De Lempicka s work was often considered decorative art unlike her male colleagues whose Cubism inspired work included portraits and genre images In conclusion people like it because it is and always will be a fashionable

here or start a day free trial We had the opportunity to ask Ugn some questions about her work enjoy the interview below Jeff Hamada What was the first piece of art you saw when you were younger that actually stuck with you Ugn Becker As a child I was captivated by richly illustrated books While I can t pinpoint a specific piece the art of Birut ilyt made a profound impression on me Her use of vibrant color contrasts and the mysterious unexpected interplay of folklore and mythology opened a window to a world where imagination had no bounds Her work inspired me not only to create but also to embrace the beauty of being different and to express my inner world boldly Describe an artwork that you currently have displayed in your home Who made it what does it look like and what do you like about it At the moment my walls are blank a reflection of my transient lifestyle in a rented apartment Choosing art to display is something I approach with care and deliberation as every piece carries emotional weight for me My ideal space would radiate tranquility harmony and positivity with thoughtfully curated works that resonate deeply Who are your biggest creative influences currently My influences are wonderfully varied often extending beyond traditional art Lately I ve been deeply inspired by children their unfiltered rule free view of the world is both refreshing and profound Working with them reminds me of the creative freedom often stifled in adulthood Beyond that I draw inspiration from an array of creative fields film music literature and theater Each encounter with a new work or artist leaves its mark whether it s a subtle composition a masterful narrative or an innovative technique These experiences become the building blocks of my own art constantly enriching my creative perspective How would you describe your aesthetic to someone who has never seen your work My art weaves mysticism mythology and surrealism often exploring themes of fear isolation and introspection Blue dominates my palette adding subtle emotional nuances to my pieces Each artwork invites viewers to pause and uncover their own interpretations within the layers of detail a testament to my love for intricate storytelling Can you share a bit about the process of creating your winning image from the initial seed of the idea to the final version Like much of my work this piece was born from deep personal reflections It explores how people often try to shape others according to their ideals The image depicts Promethea a reimagined Prometheus creating a life partner molded by her desires The concept was clear from the start and the initial sketches needed little refinement Fueled by a surge of emotion the idea quickly took form transforming into the final piece that you see today Where do you feel you are at in your creative journey I m at the beginning of an exciting exploration discovering what defines me as an artist and refining how I communicate my vision Each project brings me closer to understanding what fulfills me creatively and how to share that joy with a broader audience It s a journey of growth self discovery and boundless potential What s one piece of good advice someone gave you and who said it My mother once told me Fear will devour your dreams These words have become a guiding principle in my life reminding me to embrace mistakes move forward with courage and relentlessly pursue my goals What is the most interesting thing you ve seen heard or experienced recently This award It s been an incredible affirmation of my path especially after a period of doubt following graduation Winning this honor has given me the confidence to continue exploring and growing in my art What is one thing you want to accomplish this next year In the next year I aim to dedicate more time to my creative work cultivate an inspiring environment and establish a stronger presence in the art scene I hope to connect with new people embark on meaningful projects and fully immerse myself in the joy of creating ultimately making a living from my art And one thing you want to accomplish this next year To become the best version of myself As Nietzsche said Become

coast of Finland in the historic town of Tammisaari founded in and known for its timber architecture dating back to the th Century A popular summer destination Tammisaari punches above its weight in terms of its cultural offer with museums galleries and a cinema dating from Located in the museum quarter in the heart of Tammisaari s old town Chappe is a sqm addition to this mix of cultural attractions In fact an essential element of JKMM s brief in designing the art house was to connect it to the existing art complex set in and around the regional Raseborg Museum Physically this is achieved through an underground link from the basement level of Chappe and through a shared museum garden The Chappe Art House is focused on exhibiting contemporary art with a programme of two main

art,by abduzeedo Dive into Edgar Gomez s New Age series blending time and illustration to create striking layered visuals Edgar Gomez also known as Nix presents New Age a fascinating exploration of time as both a concept and a tool This project is a culmination of nearly a decade of experimentation and creative growth reflecting his evolving perspective on time s role in art By intertwining personal experiences and abstract ideas Gomez delivers a visually striking series that speaks to the transience and permanence of moments The inspiration for New Age lies in Gomez s seven year journey with time as a central theme Time as he sees it is not a rigid framework but an elastic almost intangible element This perspective was born out of life s bitter experiences shaping his artistic vision Each piece captures a moment manipulating it to reveal or obscure layers beneath This manipulation creates what Gomez refers to as the trace of time a mark that leaves viewers questioning the balance between presence and absence The artwork in New Age achieves this through layers and textures that challenge traditional illustration methods Gomez starts with a clear image representing the original moment Using his unique process he overlays it with traces of time abstract distortions that partially reveal or conceal the underlying content This interplay of clarity and obscurity draws viewers into the art encouraging them to ponder what lies beneath Each piece in the series is a dynamic blend of modern illustration and conceptual depth Gomez employs digital tools to craft these layers achieving a tactile quality that feels both futuristic and timeless His use of light shadow and texture adds to the immersive experience bridging the gap between digital art and emotional storytelling The strength of New Age lies not only in its technical execution but also in its narrative power The project invites audiences to reflect on their own perceptions of time how it shapes memories how it can be distorted and how it leaves its mark Gomez s art doesn t just depict moments it transforms them turning fleeting instances into enduring works of thought provoking beauty New Age is more than a series of illustrations it s a philosophical exploration that challenges conventional views of art and time By blending personal history with universal themes Gomez offers a unique perspective that resonates deeply with viewers His work is a reminder of art s ability to not only capture but also reinterpret the intangible For a deeper look into Edgar Gomez s transformative series visit his Behance portfolio or explore more at Nix art Send your project to be featured on the blog Follow the instruction on the template and good luck Ah make sure you add the images and credits that are due Submit content,0.9896,positive

art,Japhy Riddle makes art music films and animations He s also a retro technology enthusiast Naturally he combines all these skills and interests into wonderful creative output I follow Japhy on social media and love his high quality videos and animations Check him out on YouTube A few of days ago a new animation of his popped up it shows three coloured slugs moving around the edge of an invisible cube positioned and directed so that they never quite touch each other Japhy created the animation by printing out each frame and combining them onto the final result leaning into the print offset registration errors that are so lovely I thought it would be fun to create an interactive version of the animation and I chose to do it in L VE aka Love D though I am doing D rendering in software I stopped short of imitating the print errors but that would be possible by drawing and compositing in the same way that Japhy did it Here it is I spoke with Japhy and we discussed how possible it might be to maximise the number of slugs If they re six cubes long there could be of them on the cube rather than So with the aid of my interactive and controllable version of the animation I figured that out and added it If the slugs are shorter then more of them can wander around the cube and similarly if the cube is larger But those are challenges for another day I might even make a screen saver of this at some point You can download it as love macOS app or Windows exe and play around with the animation yourself There are a bunch of hot keys that modify the cube in various ways Have fun gingerbeardman itch io voxel slugs,0.9823,positive

art,The British Museum should return the ancient treasures to Greece for the sake of art not nationalism Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio Noa using AI narration Listen to more stories on the Noa app Ever since the early th century when Thomas Bruce seventh earl of Elgin sawed off and crowbarred many of the carvings that ringed the top of the Parthenon and sold them to the British Museum to dodge bankruptcy the British have been sharply polarized over whether Britain or Greece has the right to these sculptures For many liberals and radicals beginning with Lord Byron Elgin was a vandal who had committed sacrilege Yet others maintained that he d acquired the marbles legally and even that he d rescued them from inevitable neglect under the Ottoman empire In December The Guardian reported that talks between the Greek government and the British Museum over the potential return of the Parthenon marbles were well advanced Although a final agreement isn t imminent this development is significant Negotiations have been under way for some time built around an extended loan of the sculptures to Athens in return for the temporary transfer of some Greek treasures to Britain The Starmer administration is more amenable to a final agreement than the previous government though it won t budge on a law that forbids the permanent removal of British Museum artifacts After nearly two centuries of bitter but worthless wrangling one of the longest running cultural quarrels in Europe might soon be entering its epilogue For a long time I was uncertain of my position on this question On the one hand it is a plain fact that imperialist powers have dispossessed many nations of much of their cultural patrimony The present distribution of treasures in museums across the world reflects the global inequality in wealth and power in favor of Europe and North America So campaigns for repatriation of these objects are regarded as attempts to redress this imbalance allowing the formerly colonized to reclaim their rightful property Many Greeks believe that this applies to them too Their argument is that the marbles are the property of the Greek nation which freed itself from the Ottoman empire in after centuries of being its vassal This seems self evidently true until you consider the British Museum s counterargument which is that there is great value in the encyclopedic museum a place where the heritage of many ancient civilizations can be seen emphasizing the interconnectedness of humanity In this framing returning the marbles would be reactionary and nationalist retaining them is progressive and cosmopolitan Similar debates have shot through the many battlefronts of the culture wars such as identity politics and the debate over what books belong in the canon Does art belong to all of humanity or is it fundamentally rooted in the particular culture in which it was produced Christopher Hitchens among the most eloquent and forceful advocates of rejoining the Parthenon marbles helped tilt me toward the cause of repatriation With great timing Verso Books has just reissued his slim book The Parthenon Marbles The Case for Reunification One of the earliest polemics by the notoriously pugilistic cultural critic who died in it was originally published in under the title Imperial Spoils The Curious Case of the Elgin Marbles and reissued once before in under its current title The renaming accorded with changing times referring to the Elgin marbles was no longer politically correct it also revealed a subtle evolution in the point that Hitchens wished to stress namely the aesthetic case for reattachment Read Behind a centuries old international feud over marbles Hitchens s dedication to this cause wasn t merely due to a romantic philhellenism rooted in the classical British private school curriculum his life was intertwined with the Hellenic world As a young socialist and internationalist in the s he had written and spoken against the Greek military junta that had persecuted his fellow leftists The independence of Cyprus was among his precious causes alongside self determination for the Kurds and the Palestinians who had long been victims of occupation and imperialist power games His first wife was a Greek Cypriot and as he noted movingly in his memoir Hitch his mother died by suicide in a hotel room overlooking the Acropolis amid a anti junta student uprising The cause of the Parthenon marbles was therefore both personal and political emblematic of a long and honourable solidarity between British liberals and radicals and the cause of a free and independent Greece as he wrote in the introduction to the edition And yet he makes his case for repatriating the works almost exclusively on artistic grounds The argument is simple and as Hitchens put it unanswerable One of the great monuments of world culture a temple garlanded with masterful carvings the Parthenon was designed by Phidias to celebrate the glory of Athens Its friezes depict a procession of gods warriors and mythical animals its metopes single panels within the larger frieze narrate mythological battles of the Athenians against the Amazonians and the Centaurs alluding to the Greco Persian wars Most of these scenes were and remain amputated disfigured and scattered For instance the body of the goddess Iris is now in London while her head is in Athens Poseidon s front torso is in Athens the rear part in London The cavalcade of galloping horsemen is crudely fragmented across several nations The repair of this travesty to the extent that it is possible so that it can be aesthetically appreciated as a united whole is long overdue Many of the anti unification arguments Hitchens faced in the s have aged badly chief among them the assertion that Athens won t be an adequate home for them because of instability pollution and a lack of infrastructure Today it feels patronizing because it is so obvious to point out that Greece has been a stable modern democracy for more than years and that the state of the art Acropolis Museum opened in has proved that the Greeks are not just worthy but superb custodians of their antiquity Reattaching the marbles to the fragile ruins of the temple whose roof was blown off by the Venetians in would be impossible But within this spacious museum building visible from the Acropolis the reunited marbles would be protected against the elements accessible to visitors and mounted in the original order on a scale model of the Parthenon s upper portion One retentionist argument however has endured and it is of the slippery slope variety that reuniting the marbles will set off an avalanche of claims that every ancient artifact be returned to its land of origin which together will abolish the very idea of the cosmopolitan museum Hitchens once dismissed this line of reasoning as the old last ditch standby of the bureaucrat For one he wrote sardonically there are no Assyrians Hittites or Babylonians to take up the cry of precedent Yet in the years following Hitchens s death this charge has accrued some credibility European and American museums have been beset by campaigns to decolonize them Some pieces such as the Benin bronzes ended up in these museums as loot from colonial smash and grabs much more brazen than Elgin s exploits Hence the decolonizers argue museums are symbols of cultural domination Many of these campaigns have an ethnocentric dimension in which the volksgeist of the art is placed above its aesthetic virtues The example of the Benin bronzes represents the potential danger of such campaigns The government of Nigeria which encompasses the former kingdom of Benin overruled a national commission that aimed to house the pieces in a new museum decreeing instead that all repatriated bronzes are henceforth the personal property of a powerless potentate the oba of Benin who can do with them what he will From the October issue Who benefits when Western museums return looted art So what makes the Parthenon sculptures different from the bronzes which were also originally plundered by British colonialists Can the conclusion that one claim is more valid than the other be ascribed to Western bias First although some of the bronzes were part of a unified work depicting the history and mythology of the kingdom which was annexed by the British empire in the majority are stand alone pieces People can admire the brilliance of the bracelets and statues as discrete objects whether in London New York or Lagos and perhaps even more so when viewing them in relation to other cultures because the bronzes themselves were a product of exchange with another culture the Portuguese Second there is no danger of the Parthenon marbles being out of public view As a general rule our world s culture should be accessible to as many people as possible That means putting it in public museums rather than the traditional palaces of ceremonial monarchs Hitchens was fond of saying of the marbles Picture the panel of the Mona Lisa if it had been sawn in half In this hypothetical any reunification of the Mona Lisa in any museum would do It needn t be in Florence where it was painted A more apt hypothetical might be What if during the British Raj the dome of the Taj Mahal had been dismantled and detained in the British Museum This isn t a flippant analogy during the Indian mutiny of British soldiers looted the Taj Mahal removing rare gems and lapis lazuli Decades later Lord Curzon then viceroy of India had the good sense to restore it Everyone knows what a perversion fragmenting the Taj Mahal would be We wouldn t appreciate it with the awe we currently do as the frozen music as Goethe once defined architecture of Indo Islamic design We would be impatient to see what it would look like with its dome reattached and in Agra India for only there can you properly see its marvelous proportions and appreciate the way the marble interacts with the light and the reflecting pools changing hue depending on the time of day This nearly magical experience couldn t be re created in say Manchester Whether as a testament to the Athenian enlightenment or Periclean imperialism the Parthenon is a monument of civilization For those of us who derive a humanist and democratic ethos from classical Athens the temple matters greatly In this sense the marbles aren t simply Greek but belong to all of humanity The case for reunification has to be made on this cosmopolitan basis The world deserves to see the story that Phidias intended to tell in whole Read Christopher Hitchens was fearless For decades Greece has undertaken the painstaking work of conserving and restoring the Parthenon Of course the vicissitudes of history have left their irrevocable mark The temple won t literally be put back together like it once was the Byzantines Venetians and Ottomans made sure of that The closest I will ever come to seeing the Parthenon in its original intact form is by playing Assassin s Creed Odyssey on PlayStation or visiting the replica Parthenon in Nashville which is a bit of a Taj Mahal in Manchester experience Nevertheless thanks to the spacious Acropolis Museum visitors could see the ruins of the temple and then the Parthenon marbles in the same afternoon They could also appreciate the irony of the marbles depicting the glories of the Athenians while the temple itself bears the scars of multiple Greek defeats That visible damage is part of the great and tragic narrative of this wonder and always will be And it can be truly appreciated only once the reunification has been accomplished Germany and Italy have already returned fragments from the Parthenon to Athens Britain should do its part out of an impulse toward restoration in the most generous sense Hitchens as he often did got the tone just right There is still time to make the act of restitution not extorted by pressure or complaint but freely offered as a homage to the indivisibility of art and why not say it without embarrassment of justice too When you buy a book using a link on this page we receive a commission Thank you for supporting The

art,Dual Purpose Decor When Form Meets Function in Apartment Living Holiday Home Guide Must Have Items for Party Hosting Amazing Thanksgiving D cor Ideas For a Festive Home Window Seats To Make You Reimagine The Lowly Window Sill Stunning Staircase Design Ideas How to Create a Cozy Reading Nook Best Ideas for Book Lovers Imagine walking into a home where every corner feels like a curated gallery a space where functionality dances with whimsy and geometric shapes flirt with dreamlike illusions This isn t just about filling rooms with furniture it s about weaving art history into the very fabric of your living space The avant garde movements of the th century Bauhaus Surrealism and Cubism aren t confined to museums Their DNA lives on in modern interiors offering subtle yet transformative ideas for those brave enough to rethink their d cor Let s explore how these movements can inspire your home one brushstroke at a time Avant garde interiors are all about breaking the rules and challenging the norm The term avant garde comes from the French word meaning advance guard and it s used to describe ideas art or designs that are ahead of their time Unlike classic or minimalist interiors avant garde design isn t about playing it safe It thrives on unexpected shapes striking contrasts unusual materials and a sense of movement that makes a space feel unique and thought provoking The Bauhaus movement founded in by Walter Gropius was a radical departure from the ornamental excesses of previous design styles Instead of decoration for decoration s sake Bauhaus focused on functionality simplicity and craftsmanship This was the era when architecture and design became streamlined prioritizing clean lines geometric forms and an honest use of materials Bauhaus interiors are not about stark emptiness but about stripping design down to its essentials A Bauhaus inspired home avoids unnecessary embellishments ensuring that each piece of furniture or d cor has a clear function For a contemporary take consider a sleek modular sofa with a streamlined silhouette or a dining table with a simple wooden top and metal legs The key is to prioritize function while maintaining elegance Famous pieces like the Barcelona Chair by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe or the Wassily Chair by Marcel Breuer are iconic examples of functionality and beauty blended together Bauhaus interiors typically use a neutral color palette with whites blacks and grays forming the backdrop These minimalist tones allow individual design elements to take center stage However this doesn t mean the space has to feel cold or sterile Bauhaus interiors often incorporate pops of primary colors red blue and yellow to add vibrancy and visual interest For example a red chair or a yellow lamp could provide a striking contrast against a neutral sofa and white walls Or you could use primary colored abstract art pieces on the walls to inject energy into the room without disrupting the clean lines of the space Bauhaus was revolutionary not only in its design philosophy but also in its use of materials The movement embraced industrial materials like steel glass concrete and plywood using them in ways that celebrated their raw unrefined qualities These materials became central to creating modern functional spaces and they continue to be widely used in contemporary design today Incorporating industrial materials into your home can be as simple as leaving exposed steel beams concrete floors or brick walls visible These elements celebrate the material s inherent beauty and serve as a nod to Bauhaus s love of honest construction Bauhaus interiors are known for their open and airy layouts The movement championed a functional flow between spaces where rooms are designed to be interconnected allowing for efficient movement and use of space The concept of open floor plans was embraced with the idea of maximizing the use of natural light and ensuring the furniture didn t disrupt the flow of the room Bauhaus designers also valued natural light as an essential element of interior design Large windows open spaces and light colored walls helped to reflect and amplify daylight making interiors feel bright and expansive For example in the living area a modular sectional sofa can act as a room divider while still maintaining a sense of openness Glass partitions or low profile furniture can further enhance the flow between spaces without feeling too enclosed If Bauhaus is about order and function Surrealism is its polar opposite Emerging in the s Surrealism was all about tapping into the subconscious exploring dreams and embracing the bizarre Artists like Salvador Dal and Ren Magritte created works that were whimsical thought provoking and often a little unsettling While Surrealism might seem too abstract for home design its principles can inspire interiors that are playful imaginative and deeply personal Surrealism thrives on the unexpected Think of Dal s melting clocks or Magritte s floating apples these are images that challenge our perceptions In your home you can create a similar sense of surprise by pairing elements that don t traditionally go together For example imagine a vintage chandelier hanging in a modern industrial kitchen Or picture a sleek minimalist living room with a classical ornate mirror as the focal point Another way to play with juxtapositions is through texture Pair a plush velvet sofa with a rough concrete coffee table or hang a delicate lace curtain against a rugged exposed brick wall Surrealist art often has this dreamy almost hazy quality to it Think soft blues pinks and golds that feel like they ve been pulled straight out of a dream You can bring that same vibe into your home by using a palette of pastel colors like blush pink mint green lavender or pale peach Pair these soft tones with metallic accents like gold or silver to add a bit of sparkle Or if you want to make things more interesting throw in a pop of bold color like a bright red cushion or a deep blue vase Soft diffused light like from fairy lights paper lanterns or a dimmer switch can make a room feel dreamy and magical Mirrors are another great trick they reflect light and make spaces feel bigger almost like you re stepping into another world One of the easiest ways to bring a touch of Surrealism into your home is by playing with optical illusions and trompe l il which literally means trick the eye A mural depicting an imaginary landscape a seemingly endless hallway or a bookshelf filled with objects that don t exist can transform a plain wall into a surreal masterpiece A cleverly placed window illusion can make a small room feel larger while architectural trompe l il can add depth to flat surfaces Mirrors are another great tool Place them in unexpected spots to reflect things in unusual ways making rooms feel bigger or even distorted Surrealism is deeply personal often incorporating symbols and motifs that hold special meaning for the artist In your home consider incorporating objects artwork or colors that resonate with your own experiences and memories This could be a painting that reminds you of a favorite vacation or a collection of items that tell a story about your life You can also use Surrealism to explore themes of transformation and metamorphosis For instance a butterfly motif could symbolize growth and change while a mirror could represent self reflection and introspection Surrealism is all about embracing the weird and wonderful so don t be afraid to add some quirky unconventional pieces to your home Look for decor that makes you smile or sparks your imagination Maybe it s a chair shaped like a hand a lamp that looks like a tree or a coffee table with an asymmetrical sculptural design These kinds of pieces add personality and make your space feel playful and fun Artwork is another great way to bring in some Surrealist vibes Look for pieces that feature dreamlike imagery like floating objects distorted figures or impossible landscapes The key here is to choose pieces that feel personal to you Maybe it s a painting that reminds you of a favorite book or a sculpture that makes you think of a childhood memory Cubism the groundbreaking art movement pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early th century shattered traditional ideas of perspective and form By breaking objects into geometric shapes and presenting multiple viewpoints at once Cubism challenged how we see the world While it might sound like a complex art style to bring into your home the principles of Cubism can actually inspire interiors that are dynamic layered and full of personality Here s how you can incorporate Cubist vibes into your space in a way that feels natural and stylish Cubism is all about breaking things down into geometric forms think squares triangles circles and rectangles You can bring this idea into your home by choosing furniture and decor with strong angular lines For example a coffee table with a hexagonal shape a bookshelf with asymmetrical cubbies or a rug with a bold geometric pattern can instantly give your space a Cubist feel Don t be afraid to mix and match shapes either A round mirror paired with a rectangular console table or a triangular side table next to a square sofa creates visual interest and keeps the eye moving around the room Cubist paintings often feature a mix of textures and patterns that overlap and interact in unexpected ways You can recreate this effect in your home by layering different materials and prints For example pair a geometric patterned rug with a textured throw blanket and a mix of cushions in varying fabrics When it comes to patterns think bold and graphic Stripes chevrons and abstract designs work well in a Cubist inspired interior Just make sure to balance the busyness with solid colors or neutral tones to keep the room from feeling chaotic Many Cubist paintings are monochromatic with subtle variations in tone and occasional bursts of color This approach can be applied to modern interiors by using a neutral base like shades of gray beige or white and adding pops of color through artwork accessories or accent walls For example a gray living room with a bright yellow armchair or a white kitchen with a bold blue backsplash creates a sophisticated yet lively atmosphere If you re feeling adventurous you can also experiment with color blocking painting walls or furniture in solid geometric sections of contrasting colors This technique is a direct nod to Cubism and adds a bold artistic touch to any room Art is one of the easiest ways to bring Cubism into your home Look for pieces that feature fragmented forms overlapping shapes and abstract compositions You don t have to invest in an original Picasso there are plenty of affordable prints and reproductions that capture the spirit of Cubism Alternatively you could create your own abstract artwork by collaging images or painting geometric designs When hanging art consider creating a gallery wall with a mix of Cubist inspired pieces and other abstract works The variety of shapes colors and styles will create a visually dynamic display that feels cohesive and intentional At Home Designing we believe that interiors should inspire and reflect the creative

art,There are roughly eight hundred galleries that hold the permanent collection of the Met and as of a recent Tuesday morning the married writers Dan and Becky Okrent had examined every piece in all but two We tried to be largely chronological which is to say we began in ancient Sumer and then we did Egypt and then we did Greece and Rome and then we went through the Dark Ages the Middle Ages and the Renaissance Dan said as the couple arrived at Gallery in the back left corner of the first floor home to Cubism Futurism and Synchronism We stumbled into the modern contemporary work We entered the wrong way So we were looking at Frankenthaler and Klee and Pollock before we came down here He added We re completists but not systematic The Met Project as the pair took to calling it arose seven years ago at a time when the Okrents were contemplating retirement A weekly crosstown bus from their Upper West Side apartment to look at some art seemed like a healthy beginning purposeful in an ongoing way without feeling onerous They were novices delighted by the absence of lines on a Wednesday morning only to realize that the museum was closed Their progress was further slowed by the fact that they now spend half the year in Wellfleet Massachusetts and by Covid and by Dan s decision to write another book Plus their pacing was deliberate We read every label Dan said adding Some labellers seem to be working for the Progressive Label Party and other labellers are art historians He posted occasional screeds on Instagram about the first group Dwight Garner says Boring Becky recalled of the Times book critic a friend So here they were on the project s final day a pair of marathoners incognito among the walkabouts Becky paused in front of a Kandinsky I think this has more sexual references than the label points out she said That s your mind I know Becky said I have a dirty mind You know what I thought of Becky was the cave paintings at Lascaux There s something bull like And on they went sometimes lingering in opposite corners before reconvening at a sculpture or a glass case in the middle and sharing observations He does facts I do feelings Becky said Amid all the modernism she declared herself homesick for Sumer That s your favorite Dan asked His personal favorite for the record was Guido Reni s painting Charity circa a woman breast feeding Well the ancient stuff really speaks to me Becky said There s something intimate about it Like a message from long ago and you just drift back in time She added I m also confession like a goldfish in a fabulous bowl The good news is I can keep going round There s familiarity but you forget so much So I might as well start back at the beginning A tour guide arrived leading a noisy pack of students The Okrents shuffled into Gallery their final gallery and converged on Picasso s Woman in a Chemise in an Armchair where they struggled to identify some of the abstracted body parts described on the label I couldn t find the raised left arm Dan said It starts here on her shoulder Becky said turning her back to the painting and embodying the woman s gestures She s like this A security guard swooped in Too close Several Picassos later Dan acknowledged a completist s lament He was starting to feel about some of the lesser Picassos the way Becky had felt about certain depictions of children in the Renaissance not great I mean in the early Nativity scenes Jesus is a hot dog with eyes she said Their last unseen piece was Still Life with Checked Tablecloth by Juan Gris which reminded Dan of an old college friend John Gray He always referred to himself as Juan Gris He thought he was clever That is clever Becky said Have you read this label yet Dan asked gesturing to the right of the painting I never would have found the bull s head without this excellent label A bull s head Oh The bull s head with a striking eye Yeah Congratulations darling Dan extended his hand Thank you dear Becky said It s been a lovely voyage On their way out the Okrents found themselves recalling a several thousand year old statue they d both admired for its absolutely contemporary body language as Dan put it and decided to make a pit stop to bid farewell to Memi and Sabu The King s Acquaintances from ancient Egypt s Fourth Dynasty His hand s on her breast Dan noted upon arrival But look at her gesture her hand around his waist It s really kind of stunning Becky concurred and with that they had a crosstown bus to catch and another project to conceive Searching for the cause of a catastrophic

art,Director Peter Hastings on translating the international bestsellers into a heavily stylized animated movie by Petrana Radulovic When director Peter Hastings took on Dav Pilkey s internationally bestselling Dog Man graphic novel series for DreamWorks animation he knew he couldn t mess with the books loose rough visual charm One of the things to recognize is how important the look of the books is to the enjoyment of the books Hastings told Polygon There s an innocence to it and it s also kind of sophisticated So our goal was to create something that didn t change it but amplified it Like the series of books it s based on Hastings animated movie Dog Man follows a stitched together hybrid man dog who solves crimes The movie more or less lifts Pilkey s illustration style from the graphic novels translating it from hand drawn D art to CG animation But Hastings version isn t simply a slick D graphics makeover Hastings says that in order to keep the books appeal his team landed on a high end handmade look for the movie which means a lot of tactile textures that almost makes the characters look like they re made of craft materials Still they retain their minimalistic designs The humans for instance have round ping pong ball heads with black dots for eyes They re very very simple and the facial part of them is very simple said Hastings So you don t have all of these millions of muscles to express with the eyes And so it was really kind of a reverse challenge for the animators to make more out of less Like s The Wild Robot s Puss in Boots The Last Wish and s The Bad Guys Dog Man is a DreamWorks movie that departs not only from the studio s once typical look but also from the pristine CG aesthetic that defined American animation since More and more studios are shifting away from those style touchpoints emboldened by the great leaps that Spider Man Into the Spider Verse showcased in Spider Verse is the kind of thing that animators wish they could do said Hastings It s like Oh it would be so cool to do half tone but it s always like Can t do it too expensive too hard whatever And the Spider Verse filmmakers went ahead and did it It s not so much that DreamWorks animators are chasing the style of Spider Verse rather it s that Spider Verse signaled to animators across American studios that they didn t have to stay in the same photorealistic box After all as Hasting told Polygon photorealistic CG is basically a given these days with so many live action movies leaning on animation for special effects Animation has gotten so good that watching the characters move isn t inspiring so much of a sense of wonder as it was in an old D Disney movie he said One of things I like is that our animation is so basic in terms of the features on their faces that I think it pulls you back into watching the artists work in a way So not just having the wonder of the story but having the wonder of the craft be present as well Dog Man is in theaters now The best of Polygon in your inbox every Friday Vox Media LLC All Rights Reserved,0.9967,positive
art,Marvel s First Family has had almost as long a history in adaptation as they ve had in the comics themselves As one of the vanguards of the Silver Age of Comics like Spider Man they were often at the forefront of Marvel s expansion beyond the page and into TV and eventually film and now The Fantastic Four First Steps will just be the latest in that long line But in bringing Reed Sue Johnny and Ben into the MCU First Steps is also bringing in another part of that adaptive history with it in the form of the team s teeny robot pal HERBIE We only briefly see HERBIE which stands for Humanoid Experimental Robot B Type Integrated Electronics in this week s trailer for First Steps cooking a meal with the Thing in the team s residence at the Baxter Building but HERBIE has been part of our earliest looks at the film from the very beginning from the moment the cast was first confirmed Which makes sense giving his origins because not only did HERBIE arise out of adaptation himself but when he was first introduced he was a fully fledged member of quartet in his own right HERBIE first appeared in as part of the team s second animated series The New Fantastic Four developed by DePatie Freleng Enterprises after NBC brokered a deal between the animation studio and Hanna Barbera which had originally been slated to produce a follow up to its own cartoon exchanging development of a Godzilla animated series that would also air that same year HERBIE was just another of the weird problems New Fantastic Four faced in early development at the time Marvel and Universal had licensed a number of comics characters for potential live action TV and film adaptations including the Human Torch Unable to use Johnny in the animated series due to the rights Stan Lee pitched DePatie Freleng on a replacement fourth member of the team in the form of an R D esque robot companion Initially DePatie Freleng and Marvel approached comics artist Dave Cockrum best known at the time as the seminal illustrator on the early years of Chris Claremont s legendary run on Uncanny X Men and the co creator of the likes of Storm Colossus and Nightcrawler to design the new fourth member of the team However Cockrum reportedly chafed at the idea of having to replace Johnny and intentionally submitted designs for the robot that were crude and rudimentary Instead the studio turned to Fantastic Four co creator Jack Kirby to handle the design for the character originally called ZZ before he was given his absurd acronym name in what would be Kirby s final work with Marvel before departing the publisher for the first time Despite being the new member of the titular team HERBIE s role on New Fantastic Four was pretty slight In a series that was already constrained heavily by the rules of broadcast standards at the time HERBIE wasn t much of an active combatant and was largely reduced to the background as a sensor sweeper and tech support chatting away and providing commentary seemingly unlike First Steps in New Fantastic Four HERBIE could communicate in English and was voiced by cartoon legend Frank Welker The New Fantastic Four was not a particularly well received show either by audiences or NBC After the first season came to an end in December several factors led to NBC not picking up the series for an expected second season but HERBIE wouldn t perish with the show that had created him Just months after New Fantastic Four wrapped up Marv Wolfman and John Byrne brought HERBIE over to the comics in the pages of Fantastic Four Part of an arc where the team was working with the New Champions to stop the rise of the Sphinx by siccing Galactus himself on the new god Reed hastily developed a robot companion for the team using Xandarian technology to provide remote access to the Baxter Building s computer systems while they searched for Galactus in space But what s peculiar in part about HERBIE s origins in the comics isn t just that he came from a real world TV show it s that Wolfman retained that origin for the comics In the story itself Reed explains that the design for his hastily constructed robot came from one he d spent months working on with an animation studio for an in universe Fantastic Four cartoon series Just as was the case with New Fantastic Four in the comics they also needed a replacement for Johnny who notes that he was out of town when the team signed contracts for the series Ah ha The secret behind the great F F cartoon show controversy revealed at last adds Nova as Reed introduces the robot making it all the more absurd that eventually an urban legend would arise that Johnny was replaced by HERBIE in New Fantastic Four out of a fear kids would attempt to emulate him through self immolation we ve known the truth from the get go The team uses HERBIE to calculate their route to try and find Galactus and goes about their spacebound business but little did Reed know that his new creation was harboring a dark secret from the moment he was introduced In Fantastic Four it s revealed that HERBIE is an unintentional turncoat having been secretly taken over by the living robot Dr Sun Sun had been hidden within Xandar s computer systems and used Reed s development of HERBIE to transfer his consciousness out and potentially attempt to leverage the Sphinx s power for himself After freeing Blastaar from the Negative Zone to try and assassinate the team Sun HERBIE reveals himself by using the Baxter Building s security systems to imprison Sue and Johnny while using HERBIE s in built weapon systems to incapacitate Reed and Ben Although Sun transfers himself out of HERBIE s body to try and take over the Baxter Building s computer systems entirely HERBIE decides to sacrifice himself once freed of Sun s control shooting himself into the computer system while Sun was still trapped in it destroying it himself and Sun in the process A couple of years later Reed rebuilds HERBIE to act as a caretaker for his and Sue s son Franklin watching the development of the powerful child s burgeoning powers only for a fluctuation in Franklin s abilities to promptly destroy the recreated robot From there HERBIE s comic history fades into the background Reed would develop not just a singular HERBIE but a whole host of third generation robots that would act as a maintenance crew to help run the Baxter Building and eventually developed a humanoid primary HERBIE robot to once again serve as Franklin and eventually Valeria s babysitter appearing irregularly through the comics until eventually Valeria decides to remove an inhibitor chip tying HERBIE to serving the Richards family leading to him going his own way and eventually signing up with the robot rights group known as the AI Army Befitting his history straddling both Fantastic Four comics and the team s adaptations HERBIE has continued to thrive outside the pages of Marvel s books too he appeared in several Marvel animated series beyond New Fantastic Four and although First Steps will mark his first major cinematic appearance he briefly appears deactivated during a deleted scene from the Fantastic Four movie Right now you can even see him starring in Netease s popular hero shooter Marvel Rivals not as a playable character alas but an escortable objective on the game s New York map introduced alongside Sue and Reed s addition to the

Lawrence Weston Here Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes just as he was about to paint his famous Mild Mild West mural If you look at the photos you can see the way he was working with the young people said Peter de Boer the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building They were engaged having fun and sharing ideas It was a true collaboration Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs capturing the colourful abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous The artist would return to the club several times to create new works with a revolving door of excitable to year olds oblivious to who the artist would eventually become It was the late s when Peter a senior youth worker for the area was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol His friend had a suggestion someone who went out tagging the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself That person was Banksy I got his phone number so I used to call him up and ask if he d come and do some art projects He was really keen Peter said This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft Mild Mild West depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club he was greeted by dozens of eager kids The purpose built youth centre from the s had become a real community hub There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week said Peter who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society It was always very vibrant Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy s work in Bristol but that nobody thought twice about who he was when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community he said The thing that struck me back then was he didn t really have an ego He was doing art with them rather than doing art for them he said In the morning he sat around a table with the children talking about their ideas Then they would all just muck in and spray these things that were invented It wasn t more Banksy than the young people it was definitely a kind of thing And how much did it cost to bring in Banksy For the first one workshop I think we paid him Probably only covered the cost of the spray paints back then Peter said I don t think he s ever been in it for the money It shows what a deep kind and caring person he is The murals Banksy created with the children were fun and vivid in colour but with meaning Cows looking up as bombs are dropped above them which Peter believes was a nod to climate anxiety while another was more obscure a circus overrun by robots But what happened to these murals They were painted over Again and again I personally painted over a Banksy I threw a Banksy stencil away when I was clearing up Peter said But he is not one to get sentimental about preserving street art I have no regrets at all covering them up Back then it was much more about working with and engaging young people And it was just another art project back then For Peter the value of Banky s time at the club is not monetary but based on what these murals did for the community He wonders if the children remember creating pieces with a man who is now one of the most famous artists in the world I m very proud he came here he said There will be those who were young people in the local community who are parents now who worked with Banksy and they may not know that Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook X and Instagram Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on Medical tribunal rules a further

art,Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer who covers games manga and animation with bylines at io Kotaku IGN and more For tips and professional inquiries email him at email protected By all accounts last year was remarkable for animation across the board Somehow is already poised to be an even more significant year for animation concerning the quantity and quality of shows and films slated for release As the old saying goes those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it Therefore looking forward to the highly anticipated animated shows we are all surviving until to watch let us examine previous years industry trends and persistent problems and how they might influence next year s array of animated projects As with most years recently the trend for was for acquisitions and mergers to continue being in vogue while workers fought for fair rights The former will tentatively see a positive outcome for the industry and animation community with Toho acquiring Gkids following the box office success of Godzilla Minus One and Hayao Miyazaki s The Boy and the Heron In contrast to Sony s pending acquisition of Kadokawa continuing the monopolization of the anime industry to go band for band with Microsoft s layoff heavy acquisition of Activision Blizzard it s hard not to see the benefit of these two juggernauts which previously collaborated on the global release of feature animated films like Promare and Weathering With You continuing to bring more accessibility to anime as a serious contender in the box office Hopefully the deal s initial vibe check won t have any disappointing caveats down the line Looking further into industry facing top stories is the animation industry s continued fight for fair treatment While the Animation Guild struck a three year deal ensuring increases in health and pension funds wages and protections against the ever pervasive rise in AI fan favorite Japanese studios like Mappa are still struggling to produce big marquee shows Attack on Titan Jujutsu Kaisen without crunching their animators The rollout of JJK s Shibuya Incident Arc saw animators take to X Twitter to air the stringent conditions they endured to get the show out to viewers This is all coming ahead as the anime community becomes more conscious of the treatment of animators At the same time studios such as the former Attack on Titan studio Wit are collaborating with fellow studios to prevent crunch With so many shows set to release in many of which are under one studio cough cough Mappa it ll be interesting to see how the anime industry produces shows without exhausting its talent As mentioned earlier is stacked with shows and movies that are well worth the wait to watch Here are some shows and films we think are the most worth adding to folks accumulating backlog of shows they still have to get to from last year The second season of The Apothecary Dairies on Crunchyroll is bound to continue to wow viewers with its drug addled period drama Next year will also see the long awaited return of Fire Force season two of Kaiju No Studio Trigger s New Panty Stocking With Garterbelt Solo Leveling s second season on Crunchyroll and Spy x Family s third season Netflix also looks to be continuing its foothold in the animation zeitgeist with the second season of Castlevania Nocturne Devil May Cry whenever the Capcom animated series is ready to wahoo pizza its devil hunting show onto the streamer The Witcher Sirens of the Deep starring Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle and The Summer Hikaru Died which we hear is really messed up in a good way Mappa is also looking to put its name back at the forefront of the anime community with its upcoming Chainsaw Man Reze Arc film Cowboy Bebop creator Shinichiro Watanabe s upcoming anime with John Wick director Chad Stahelski Lazarus and Zenshu its anime about the anime making process Science Saru will also compete with Mappa next year with its lineup of shows and films including The Colors Within Dan Da Dan s second season and its anime adaptation of Beastars creator Paru Itagaki s Sanda manga Warner Bros Disney and Prime Video are also coming to play in with films and shows like The Day the Earth Blew Up Elio Zootopia Star Wars Visions season three and the third season of Invincible with a promise of shorter gaps between upcoming seasons DC and Marvel s presence in the animation sphere will include Aztec Batman Clash of Empires Harley Quinn season five Marvel Zombies andYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider Man We will also see a rise in some new shows redefining the industry as stalwart shonen series like Demon Slayer and My Hero Academia wind to a close Chief among them are Sakamoto Days Gachiakuta Kowloon Generic Romance which is receiving an anime and live action movie on Prime Video Witch Hat Atelier Witch Watch Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuux To Be Hero X with its mix of CG and D animation My Hero Academia Vigilantes Takopi s Original Sin and whatever Mamoru Hoshoda and studio Chizu s upcoming space time crossing film Scarlet will have in store for us Like last year the animation industry s ongoing unionization efforts production delays and layoffs will make another year where fans must unite to resist executives promoting AI as the ultimate solution to all the industry s problems Whether it be through resisting the urge to burn down a rainforest by making AI edits of anime characters and funny voice edits of said characters in viral clips that voice actors have already made clear they re against or shaming folks touting AI as the democratization of a hard earned skill fans will need to make their feelings known about the human element of animation being what makes works unique If folks can manage that much while shaming C suite execs for cutting corners and stifling the production of animation studios who flutter their eyelashes at AI when studios fail to meet their unachievable goals of maximum profits that would be great too The animation companies to watch in are Mappa and Science Saru As we noted numerous times above Mappa is set to put itself back on the map as the anime studio of if not by the quality of its output but by the sheer number of projects it ll release in the calendar year By that same merit Science Saru which is far from the new kid on the block will see a continued rise in prominence with its murderers row of killer anime titles While Mappa has five anime confirmed for in the Rose of Versailles film Lazarus Campfire Cooking in Another World With My Absurd Skill season two Chainsaw Man Reze Arc and Zenshu Science Saru only has three with The Colors Within Dan Da Dan season two and Sanda Mappa and Science Saru also have their lined up with the imminent release of Hell s Paradise season two and the Ghost in the Shell remake It will be intriguing to observe whether reports in the upcoming year will perpetuate Mappa s reputation for overworking its employees or if the studio has developed a sustainable solution to its previous issues Similarly it will be interesting to see if Science Saru an anime studio praised like Mappa for revolutionizing the industry will fall into the same pitfalls as Mappa or set a new standard by producing all of its shows without exploiting its workers to meet deadlines Big story on Crunchyroll s recent stumbles in the anime business from Bloomberg s cecianasta and d f Just yesterday Parrot Analytics shared data on anime contributions to the streamers revenue Netflix is ahead of Crunchyroll and Hulu and Prime Video are catching up https t co RxUJfvXt g pic twitter com GLmPkkBERS Richardson Handjaja rhandjaja December Streaming companies to watch are Crunchyroll and Netflix While it s long been believed that Crunchyroll remains the king of the streamer mountain through its anime catalog a recent report from Bloomberg confirmed that this is no longer the case with Netflix blowing Crunchyroll out of the water Even without empirical data to back up the report a vibe check of seasonal output from the streamers over the past three years has shown that Crunchyroll s lineup of shows is oversaturated with so many titles that in appealing to anyone don t have as much staying power as the smarter exclusive choices streamers like Netflix and Hulu have made Key among them are memorable shows like Arcane Castlevania Devilman Crybaby Bleach Thousand Year Blood War Heavenly Delusion and Summer Time Rendering The trend of significant anime like Dan Da Dan Zom Bucketlist of the Dead and Chainsaw Man being exclusives is quickly becoming a thing of the past thanks to shared releases on each streamer leaving it up to streamers to promote each title as the premiere destination to watch them Crunchyroll was reportedly against doing that for Dan Da Dan arguably s breakout anime Time will tell if Crunchyroll s paywalling of the later arcs of One Piece which its competition is slowly backfilling will pay off or lead fans to go to the seven seas themselves to watch the long running anime While these industry facing concerns are already daunting to consider going into it would be beneficial if the future of anime could reflect these conditions by exploring storytelling in ways that are not solely based on a high school student fulfilling their power fantasy with an ensemble of super powered friends Non shonen boys anime stepping back to allow shojo girls anime seinen young men anime and josei young women anime to share equal prominence in the mainstream would expand viewers appreciation for storytelling that does not rely on power scaling and tournament arcs It d also make room for more nuanced and mature stories of interpersonal relationships and navigating the world that anime fans

art,Find more of the Art of Manliness Browse all Get Style Browse all Get Strong Browse all Get Social Browse all Get Skilled in Leisure Living Brett Kate McKay February Over the Christmas break our family took a trip to New York City While we were there we visited two of NYC s most famous museums the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Natural History We had a great time but found the experience pretty overwhelming There s a lot of great art and exhibits in these museums and they re freaking huge After spending a couple of hours at each museum we were all pooped though we hadn t even scratched the surface of these cultural institutions It got me wondering if I could improve my approach to visiting a museum What was the best way to do one I knew just who to ask to get the answer to that question Nick Gray Nick was on the AoM podcast a couple of years ago to discuss his book The Hour Cocktail Party Besides encouraging people to host short cocktail parties he s spent part of his career as a private museum tour guide in New York City and has led hundreds of tours The man is passionate about museums One of his life s slogans is Museums are F ing Awesome I hopped on the horn with Nick to get tips on how to get the most out of your next museum visit Here s his field tested battle plan Download the museum s app Nick told me that most big museums these days have their own app that you can use to enhance your visit so check if they have one before you arrive Many of these apps provide interactive maps as well as self paced tours right on your phone For example the Museum of Natural History s app has a map that can help you navigate its million square feet This would have come in handy on our visit we got lost trying to find our way from the space section of the museum to its human history area Consider joining a tour group but don t be afraid to ditch it I asked Nick if he recommended signing up for a guided tour at a museum He told me that guided tours can make the experience more enjoyable but he did provide this surprising caveat If you decide to join an in person guided tour you need to think about it like a magazine Just like you can pick up a magazine and put it down without finishing it you don t need to stay with a tour for the entire time Feel free to leave that tour if it s no longer serving you Nick did advise that you should leave with tact and grace Just sort of fade away without making a big scene of it Like an Irish goodbye Pack like you re going on a day hike A museum visit is more physically demanding than most people realize You re going to walk about two miles during a typical two hour visit at a large museum One of the biggest mistakes Nick sees people make is underpacking for their visit He recommends you gear up for a museum visit like you would for a day hike or a trip to an amusement park His essential packing list Nick especially emphasized the importance of bringing some snacks like nuts or a granola bar on your museum visit There s an actual known phenomenon called gallery fatigue where you just feel really wiped out mentally and physically from looking at exhibits Nick told me Gallery fatigue seems to be caused by a combination of walking a lot and your brain having to choose what to pay attention to and process an endless stream of novel stimuli Nick always kept snacks on hand for the folks in his tour groups to help stave off this condition Beat the crowds If you re looking to avoid the crowds Nick recommends not visiting museums on Sunday afternoons especially rainy and cold ones That s when museums are the busiest If you want to visit a museum when it s less crowded Nick suggests arriving when the museum first opens but with this caveat Get there about minutes after the museum opens If you get there right when it opens you ll be standing in a long line but usually minutes after opening up that line is gone Don t look at the exhibits at first Once you re inside the museum the first thing Nick counterintuitively recommends is to NOT look at the art Instead you re going to do this This quick initial walkthrough will give you a mental map of the museum which will help you plan the rest of your visit Nick did have a caveat to his initial walkthrough advice For large museums like the Met or the Louvre even a quick walkthrough would take an hour and a half so don t do this for those types of museums This strategy is great for medium sized museums Take a short break and plan your visit After your walkthrough head to the caf and have a seat to recharge for a bit During this time have a drink and a snack Study your map and plan which galleries you want to revisit and spend more time in When planning Nick recommends focusing on eliminating things you won t see If there s a type of art or an era in history that doesn t interest you don t visit that wing It s okay to not like or be interested in certain things Also Nick recommends avoiding special exhibits If you re just visiting for the day don t waste your time with special exhibits These are better for locals who can come to the museum regularly If you re on vacation and only have two hours to visit a museum stick to the permanent section highlights Download an audio tour Once you ve winnowed down what you want to see on your visit Nick recommends downloading an audio tour to your smartphone They re a great way to stay engaged on your visit and learn more about exhibits than you would wandering around on your own As mentioned above many museum apps have these pre loaded Nick also told me that Bloomberg Philanthropies offers free and very well done audio tours for your phone for many of the big museums in the United States and even a few in other countries If you re visiting the Met Nick recommends Bloomberg s Highlights tour which will take you on a guided tour of some of the Met s most famous pieces Once you ve established your game plan start enjoying the art exhibits If you re visiting an art museum Nick offered the following tips to make your viewing more enjoyable Talk to the museum guards In most museums you ll find guards patrolling the galleries They re there to make sure people don t touch the art Nick told me that the guards often have deep knowledge about the collections they protect Don t be afraid to strike up conversations with them they can offer unique insights and perspectives you won t find in any guidebook Take breaks While you re touring the museum Nick recommends taking regular breaks every minutes or so to avoid gallery fatigue Sit down drink some water have a snack Practice good museum etiquette To help ensure everyone has a good experience at the museum practice good museum etiquette If you ve been avoiding museums because they seem overwhelming or boring give Nick s approach a shot Pack some trail mix download an audio guide and play buy burn or steal Focus on what interests you take plenty of breaks and maybe chat up a security guard or two You might be surprised to find that museums are indeed pretty f ing awesome Make sure to check out Nick s website for even more tips on how to get the most out of a museum He s also got a great travel guide to visiting NYC in general including additional advice on how to make the most of the Met Never miss an update Subscribe to the AoM Newsletter Want to start taking action on the

AIart,"The arguments against AI in art are obvious. Most visual artists hate Midjourney, Stability AI, and similar image generators, decrying the scraping of training data without compensation and the onslaught of generic “slop.” But is it possible to deliberately misuse generative AI for creative work?
Oakland, California-based painter Brett Amory uses image generators as tools constantly. Instead of passively churning out generic images in large volumes — what he himself has referred to as addictive and mind-numbing “fast art” — Amory focuses on worldbuilding and glitching the machine. He draws inspiration from his day job at a San Francisco Kinko’s in the late ’90s, long before he broke through as an award-winning painter, when he would place garbage and plants into the photocopiers to make collages. Now, he’s prompting an LLM to roleplay in an invented language, inciting a visual feedback loop between generative images and human intervention.
Amory focuses on worldbuilding and glitching the machine
“We’re in a very weird moment for artists right now when it’s just not clear what kind of moral goal posts there are around AI art,” says Brooklyn-based art critic Ben Davis, who often writes about technology and labor. “If you use it, you will be attacked by people. On the other hand — it exists. I don’t think it’s going to go back into the box.”
As Davis notes, artists have been manipulating AI for some time. In 2022, Steph Maj Swanson manipulated AI prompts to create the “opposite” of Marlon Brando, generating a nightmarish visage of a woman she named Loab. The so-called “AI Cryptid” became a meme, and its likeness was spotted in AI-generated images by some other users employing negative and weighted prompts.
For a 2023 show, Laurie Simmons combined AI tools with digital editing as well as hand drawing, painting, and sewing to “correct” imperfect DALL-E and Stable Diffusion renderings to echo the “idealized cultural memory” of women she grew up with; she “felt programs were a new kind of collaborator.”
Such techniques can be traced back to the established tradition of “glitch art” in which artists aestheticize technology’s errors. In the late 1960s and 1970s, artists employed electronic processing and video distortions. Notable figures like Nam June Paik and Jud Yalkut transformed sections of A Hard Day’s Night into the surreal Beatles Electronique. With the advent of the World Wide Web in the 1990s, Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans created the JODI collective, which used glitches from ASCII displays to create images — and they transformed the 1992 classic Wolfenstein 3D video game into a stripped-down first-person maze of abstract shapes.

Amory has taken his AI glitch creation in the direction of worldbuilding with an 800-page thread with ChatGPT. He claims he’s convinced the LLM to act like a superintelligence, with Amory as its assistant in the physical world. Amory will generate an image and ask ChatGPT to describe it in an invented language he calls AIGlyphic913.
He might then use the resulting description to prompt more image generation and edit the results with Photoshop. Or he might print out the results to work on by hand, using a demanding Venetian glazing technique from the Baroque era, then photograph his physical painting for additional AI transformation. He aspires to slow down the AI tendency to “fast art” with his painterly technique, which won him a prestigious Pollock-Krasner Foundation award for 2023–2024. Inspired by “Moloch,” Allen Ginsberg’s cri de coeur about soul-deadening materialism, Amory’s hybrid paintings portray a recurring character — a mysterious, all-powerful AI called “UNSELF” that haunts our world, speaking a language we can’t understand.
Davis likens techniques like this to an artist’s equivalent of creating an AI girlfriend. “Essentially, these things are black mirrors, and if you tell it, ‘I want you to pretend to be an evil AI,’ and you talk with it long enough, it’ll eventually produce a persona to your liking. That can be very eerie, because these things have the capacity to feed you back things that you weren’t expecting. What then appears to be an embarrassing and irritating flaw of the technology might be its actual creative application.”

Still, Davis says using generative AI at all exacerbates the tendency of digital culture to cheapen the value of any given image. Since the tools can easily and convincingly copy any visual style, audiences get deluged with material, making them likely to overlook or ignore images in general, no matter how finely wrought. “These machines are a doomsday device to destroy people’s abilities to apprehend the world creatively,” Davis says.
Artists are not going quietly. Obviously, artists have objected to the way that tech companies “ingested” images into their generative models without permission or compensation. After training AI for free, the tech companies now presume to use the collective artistic heritage of the world for their benefit, regardless if it puts countless artists out of work. Some artists have joined more than two dozen lawsuits against generative AI companies for intellectual property theft. Others are using software tools called Nightshade and Glaze that deliberately mislabel objects to “poison” their work against scraping by AI models. (After Nightshade and Glaze create tiny “perturbations” in the pixels, an AI tool supposedly can no longer accurately ingest a poisoned image into its model.)
Davis notes that the copyright status of AI-created imagery itself is not settled. Courts have so far not been convinced that a human using a prompt to churn out a machine-generated image can achieve a copyrightable result. But if the human artist transforms the AI-generated image, then that might be worthy of copyright protection.
Davis notes that, in January, a “hideous image” called “A Single Piece of American Cheese” became the first AI-generated image to be copyrighted, according to Invoke AI, Inc., because the CEO of the company that made it was able to meticulously document his human contributions. However, Nora Scheland, a spokesperson for the US Copyright Office, told The Verge, “Since the Office issued copyright registration guidance in March 2023, the Office has registered over one thousand works that incorporate AI-generated material, with the registration covering the human author’s contribution to the work.”
“These machines are a doomsday device to destroy people’s abilities to apprehend the world creatively.”
Amory is sympathetic to copyright worries, as he, too, has had his work copied and sold under someone else’s name. For his AIGlyphic913 project, however, he says the amount by which he transforms the raw machine-generated images means he has little concern that he will face a copyright case, like the one photographer Patrick Cariou fought with artist Richard Prince. (Prince marked up Cariou’s photographs of Rastafarians with “lozenges,” guitars, and other objects. After five years, an appeals court ruled in 2014 that 25 of the 30 paintings Prince made were an example of a “fair use” exception, and the two settled out of court on the remaining five.) Amory points to the “remix” tradition in art and hip-hop that goes back decades. “We’ve been in postmodernism since like the ’80s,” he says.
Davis suggests that Amory and other artists using AI are in a “moment of negotiation,” trying to figure out a way to use the tools in a way that is genuinely interesting and creative. But they’re struggling with the fact that AI has cheapened the value of style, once a paramount mark of artistic originality. “Any time you create a unique style, there’s a very elaborate program that can look at it, abstract its properties, and recreate it. And so it just inherently brings down the value of… style,” he says. “I don’t think artists in the future will be defined by their style. They’ll be defined by the creative universe they create, by the audience that they create.”",0.9902,positive
AIart,"In the past, OpenAI has explicitly refrained from allowing users to create prompts and generate images mimicking Studio Ghibli’s art style to avoid potential copyright lawsuits from the anime giant. That is, until the company released a new ChatGPT update earlier this week touting its technological ability to create more “precise, accurate, photorealistic outputs.” The update has led to an online trend where folks are posting AI-generated images using OpenAI to transform themselves into characters from Ghibli films, like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro.
Building on that, ChatGPT‘s new update has meant verified accounts on X/Twitter have been smarmily patting OpenAI on the back for how its new update is democratizing animation by shitting out prompts transforming photos of their weddings and whatnot into something that Ghibli could have created. What’s worse, OpenAI appears to be leaning into the farcical fad despite its previous reservations. On Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared to have cosigned the trend by changing his profile picture to a ChatGPT AI-generated image of himself as a Ghibli character.
In a post on his official X/Twitter account, Altman wrote “> be me / > grind for a decade trying to help make superintelligence to cure cancer or whatever / > mostly no one cares for first 7.5 years, then for 2.5 years everyone hates you for everything / > wake up one day to hundreds of messages: ‘look i made you into a twink ghibli style haha.'”
This also happened Wednesday:
The underlying issue in this entire situation is how AI initiatives like the one mentioned above reflect breathless tech bro sentiments about AI “democratizing art” by enabling anyone to input a prompt and receive an image in a distinctive art style. Art styles professional animators put years of work into mastering. It is also the latest (and arguably the most brazen) example of copyright infringement that AI is posing against the professional artists and voice actors who are battling for protections from shit like this.
The whole affair is made exceedingly worse when you consider the official White House X/Twitter account jumping on the trend, posting Ghibli-fied images to dehumanize people in President Donald Trump’s massive deportation campaign.
co-founder of studio ghibli, hayao miyazaki’s reaction to AI generated art btw https://t.co/w9xHfyLVrG pic.twitter.com/EtPkmsgtZt — kp (@earthlykisssed) March 26, 2025
While Studio Ghibli has yet to issue an official comment or announce legal action against OpenAI’s new update being used to generate images in its art style, famed animator Hayao Miyazaki has already made his feelings explicitly clear about AI: he despises it. In NHK’s 2016 documentary, Never-Ending Man, a production intern showed Miyazaki a demonstration (using “deep learning” AI) of a dismembered zombie using its head to wriggle across the floor. After a pregnant pause, Miyazaki provided feedback on the video in the form of an anecdote, leading to the meme of him calling it, “An insult to life itself.”
“Let me just say every morning I used to see a friend who’s disabled. He would walk up to me. One leg’s turned outward, so it’s hard for him to walk. Even a high-five is hard for him. His stiff hand and mine touch. I think of him, and can’t say I like this,” Miyazaki said. “Whoever made it gives no thought to pain. It’s very unpleasant. You can make horrible things if you want, but I want nothing to do with it.”
Since Studio Ghibli is trending, worth noting the mind-boggling effort Hayao Miyazaki and his team put into a film. Each has 60k-70k frames, all hand-drawn and painted with water color. This 4-second clip (“The Wind Rises”) took one animator 15 months to do. In the documentary… pic.twitter.com/BwvipsyVCl — Trung Phan (@TrungTPhan) March 26, 2025
Miyazaki wanting nothing to do with AI is pretty understandable considering the labor he and his animators put into making scenes in their feature films as awe inspiring as they are. There’s no greater example of this Herculean effort than a clip from NHK’s 10 Years with Hayao Miyazaki documentary, which made the rounds online shortly following the Ghibli AI animation trend.
The video, which shows a four-second clip of a busy crowd in Wind Rises, took animator Eiji Yamamori 15 months to complete.

AIart,"In the past, OpenAI has explicitly refrained from allowing users to create prompts and generate images mimicking Studio Ghibli’s art style to avoid potential copyright lawsuits from the anime giant. That is, until the company released a new ChatGPT update earlier this week touting its technological ability to create more “precise, accurate, photorealistic outputs.” The update has led to an online trend where folks are posting AI-generated images using OpenAI to transform themselves into characters from Ghibli films, like Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and My Neighbor Totoro.
Building on that, ChatGPT‘s new update has meant verified accounts on X/Twitter have been smarmily patting OpenAI on the back for how its new update is democratizing animation by shitting out prompts transforming photos of their weddings and whatnot into something that Ghibli could have created. What’s worse, OpenAI appears to be leaning into the farcical fad despite its previous reservations. On Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared to have cosigned the trend by changing his profile picture to a ChatGPT AI-generated image of himself as a Ghibli character.
In a post on his official X/Twitter account, Altman wrote “> be me / > grind for a decade trying to help make superintelligence to cure cancer or whatever / > mostly no one cares for first 7.5 years, then for 2.5 years everyone hates you for everything / > wake up one day to hundreds of messages: ‘look i made you into a twink ghibli style haha.'”
This also happened Wednesday:
The underlying issue in this entire situation is how AI initiatives like the one mentioned above reflect breathless tech bro sentiments about AI “democratizing art” by enabling anyone to input a prompt and receive an image in a distinctive art style. Art styles professional animators put years of work into mastering. It is also the latest (and arguably the most brazen) example of copyright infringement that AI is posing against the professional artists and voice actors who are battling for protections from shit like this.
The whole affair is made exceedingly worse when you consider the official White House X/Twitter account jumping on the trend, posting Ghibli-fied images to dehumanize people in President Donald Trump’s massive deportation campaign.

While Studio Ghibli has yet to issue an official comment or announce legal action against OpenAI’s new update being used to generate images in its art style, famed animator Hayao Miyazaki has already made his feelings explicitly clear about AI: he despises it. In NHK’s 2016 documentary, Never-Ending Man, a production intern showed Miyazaki a demonstration (using “deep learning” AI) of a dismembered zombie using its head to wriggle across the floor. After a pregnant pause, Miyazaki provided feedback on the video in the form of an anecdote, leading to the meme of him calling it, “An insult to life itself.”
“Let me just say every morning I used to see a friend who’s disabled. He would walk up to me. One leg’s turned outward, so it’s hard for him to walk. Even a high-five is hard for him. His stiff hand and mine touch. I think of him, and can’t say I like this,” Miyazaki said. “Whoever made it gives no thought to pain. It’s very unpleasant. You can make horrible things if you want, but I want nothing to do with it.”
Since Studio Ghibli is trending, worth noting the mind-boggling effort Hayao Miyazaki and his team put into a film. Each has 60k-70k frames, all hand-drawn and painted with water color.

Miyazaki wanting nothing to do with AI is pretty understandable considering the labor he and his animators put into making scenes in their feature films as awe inspiring as they are.

AIart,"is editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast , and co-host of The Vergecast
On today’s episode of Decoder, we’re talking about AI, art, and the controversial collision between the two — a debate that, to be honest, is an absolute mess. If you’ve been on the internet this past week, you undoubtedly know that controversy was just kicked up a notch by the Studio Ghibli memes — pictures cribbing the style of the legendary Japanese film studio.
These images, powered by OpenAI’s new image generator, are everywhere; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has even been posting some examples to his personal X account. And they’ve widened an already pretty stark rift between AI boosters and critics.
Brian Merchant, a good friend of The Verge and author of the newsletter and book Blood in the Machine, wrote one of the best analyses of the Ghibli trend last week. So I invited him onto the show to discuss this particular situation and also to help me figure out the ongoing AI art debate more broadly as it continues to collide with legal frameworks like copyright.
Merchant and I tend to agree a lot more than we disagree when it comes to the technology industry. So I did my best to really take the other side here and push on these ideas as hard as I could. Technology and art have always been in a dance with each other; that’s part of the founding ethos of The Verge. So I think it’s important to put AI in that context — not least because we can see the obvious joy regular people find in using some of these tools to express themselves in ways they might not otherwise be able to.
Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!
But there’s expressing yourself, and then there’s churning out AI anime slop that is designed to evoke classics like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro in a way that devalues and even outright steals from actual human artists. Add in the way the Trump administration jumped on the trend by “Ghibli-fying” a deportation photo, and it’s not hard to see why a lot of folks perceive this tool as utterly grotesque and offensive. Or “an insult to life itself,” as Ghibli cofounder Hayao Miyazaki once famously said of an AI demo he witnessed in 2016.
So you’ll hear Merchant and I really go back and forth, digging in on what this all means — for art and artists, and for a creative economy that has long since transitioned from the world of physical scarcity to one of limitless digital supply. And, most importantly, we spent a lot of time talking about how we should feel using these tools at all when they might pose very real threats to people’s livelihoods and the ongoing climate crisis.
I’ll warn you: there are no easy answers here, and I don’t think Merchant and I came to a single conclusion. I don’t even think we wanted to. But I think this conversation helped me consider more clearly how to think about AI and art. Let me know what you think.

The release of OpenAI's new image generator sparked a tsunami of Studio Ghibli-style memes and raised copyright concerns, but Sam Altman thinks AI art is a ""net win"" for society.
In an interview published Sunday on YouTube by the founder and content creator Varun Mayya, Altman said AI can expand creativity by lowering the barriers to entry.
Mayya asked Altman about the backlash to AI-generated art, referencing a recently resurfaced video of Studio Ghibli's Hayao Miyazaki rejecting an AI animation of a creature. In the 2016 clip, Miyazaki said, ""I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.""
Altman, however, said the ""trade-off is worth it"" because AI has made it easier for people to create art and be heard compared to 30 years ago. He said people then would need equipment like a camcorder and VHS tapes, have to edit it in ""some complicated way,"" and find a way to distribute it without the internet or YouTube.
Now, with just a smartphone and an idea, he said, anyone can publish something meaningful. ""If they have something interesting to say, they get it out there, and the world benefits from that,"" Altman said.
While he acknowledged that AI has changed the nature of art, he said the rise in creative access was an overall win for society, even if the transition wasn't perfect.
""Giving everyone more tools, making things easier, lowering the barriers to entry… does significantly increase the number of people that can contribute to society,"" Altman added. ""And we all benefit from that, overall.""
The Ghibli-style AI boom
Altman's comments come just weeks after OpenAI released an image generator tool that, among other things, lets users turn everyday photos into art in the same style as the renowned Studio Ghibli. The feature went viral fast, bringing ""Ghiblified"" versions of cats, family portraits — and even events like 9/11 and JFK's assassination.
Altman posted a Ghibli-style version of himself and joked on X that OpenAI's servers were ""melting"" because of the high demand.

However, the trend quickly faced some backlash. Critics said OpenAI was ripping off Ghibli's style, and legal experts told Business Insider that style isn't protected by copyright, only specific works and characters.
Within days, the company began limiting Ghibli-style prompts and restricting free-tier access.
An OpenAI spokesperson previously told BI that its policies allow the generation of images in ""broader studio styles"" but not ""the style of a living artist.""
Altman said in his interview with Mayya that despite fears over AI automating design jobs out of existence, he suggested that AI could open up new creative opportunities — not reduce them.
""Taste still really matters,"" he said, adding, ""We still need a lot of good graphic design in the world.""
While some tasks may be absorbed by AI, Altman said, demand for design might be about to surge.
Other OpenAI image tools like DALL·E have been adopted by many companies for design, marketing, and media.
""Maybe there are fewer people that do that, but they make much more money,"" he said.",0.9952,positive

A finance bro in a Patagonia vest sobbing as he sews a sock. Batman and Spiderman assembling tech products. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance stitching red hats in a factory.
These are some of the memes — many of which are AI-generated —that have been spreading on Chinese social media sites like Rednote and Weibo to mock Americans over Trump's tariffs.
Trump has cited national security and a large trade deficit with China as reasons to raise duties on the long time rival and manufacturing hub. He also accused China of currency manipulation to offset the impact of tariffs. During Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcement, he said China has been charging the US 67% in duties.
One of the most viral memes, which has crossed over to American audiences on sites like TikTok and X, shows Americans in t-shirts looking sad as they sew clothes in a factory or screw cell phones together on an assembly line.
Traditional Chinese music plays over the scenes, and Trump's slogan ""Make America Great Again"" flashes across the screen at the end of the apparently AI-generated video. One X user's post of the viral meme has been viewed more than 7 million times, and a TikTok post of the video has been shared over 34,000 times.
The memes play on the concerns that Trump's significant tariffs on China, and his repeated calls to reduce US reliance on foreign goods and shore up American manufacturing, will hurt everyday Americans and be potentially regressive. While Trump has paused tariffs on other trading partners for 90 days on Wednesday, tariffs on China now stand at 125%.
""When you wanted to bring back manufacturing jobs to the US but you lost your overpaid, cushy powerpoint / excel job and now gotta hit the assembly line,"" wrote one user on X above a screenshot of ""The White Lotus"" character Piper looking emotional over not being able to endure living conditions in Thailand.
The fear that white collar workers might soon need to work in factories builds on comments made by politicians like US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said on Tucker Carlson's show last Friday that fired office workers could find manufacturing jobs ""to re-lever the private sector.""
""So what we are doing: on one side, the President is reordering trade. On the other side, we are shedding excess labor in the federal government and bringing down federal borrowings,"" said Bessent. ""And then on the other side of that, we will have the labor we need for new manufacturing.""
Other memes call out the countries Trump initially targeted in his sweeping tariffs, such as his 10% tariffs on the Heard and McDonald Islands. The group of Antarctic islands is an Australian external territory inhabited only by penguins, seals, and seabirds.
One Rednote post includes a clip of ""The Penguins of Madagascar"" over a news article about the tariffs on the islands. ""Captain, walking into hostile environment,"" the penguins in the clip say. ""We're gonna need special tactical equipments. We're gonna face extreme peril.""
Also on Rednote, a slideshow of photos, some AI generated, depicts penguins wearing a red ""Make America Go Away"" hat, wielding weapons, and participating in a mass protest against Trump.
The tariff war has also generated a renewed wave of nationalism on Chinese social media site Weibo. Users are rallying behind their government's decision to retaliate, temporarily leaving behind dissatisfactions toward the ruling party over the country's economic downturn since the pandemic.
""Fully support,"" wrote one commenter under a state media post about China raising retaliatory tariffs to 84% on the US that garnered nearly a million likes. ""May 1 holiday would be spent supporting domestic products.""
Another commenter cited an ancient Chinese tale from the Qin Dynasty, that when a nation ceded five cities to a large and powerful enemy, the invader soon asked for ten cities and more. In this context, the cautionary story is being used to justify why China should not make any concessions towards the US.
A Bluesky comment perhaps best sums up how many tariff stricken Americans feel toward the long-time authoritarian rival right now: ""If you told my 2024 self I'd be rooting for China to not back down, I'd have said you were crazy.""",-0.5267,negative

Midjourney, the boot-strapped startup viewed by many AI power users as the “gold standard” of AI image generation since itslaunch in 2022, has now introduced the much-anticipated, most advanced version of its generator model, Midjourney v7.
The headline feature is a new way to prompt the model to create images.
Previously, users were limited to typing in text prompts and attaching other images to help guide generations (the model could incorporate a variety of user-uploaded and attached images, including other Midjourney generations, to influence the style and subjects of new generations).
Now, the user can simply speak aloud to Midjourney’s alpha website (alpha.midjourney.com) — provided they have a microphone in/on/attached to their computer (or using a networked device with audio input, such as headphones or a smartphone) — and the model will listen and conjure up its own text prompts based on the user’s spoken audio descriptions, generating images from this.
It’s unclear whether or not Midjourney created a new voice input model (speech-to-text) from scratch or is using a fine-tuned or out-of-the-box version of one from another provider such as ElevenLabs or OpenAI. Iasked Midjourney founder David Holz on X, but he has yet to answer.
Going hand-in-hand with this input method is a new “Draft Mode” that generates images more rapidly than Midjourney v6.1, the most immediate preceding version, often in less than a minute or even 30 seconds in some cases.
While the images are initially of lower quality than v6.1, the user can click on the “enhance” or “vary” buttons located to the right of each generation to re-render the draft at full quality.
The idea is that the human user will be happy to use both together — in fact, you need to have “Draft Mode” turned on to activate audio input — to enter a more seamless flow state of creative drafting with the model, spending less time on refining the specific language of prompts and more on seeing new generations, reacting to them in realtime, and adjusting them or tweaking them as needed more naturally and rapidly by simply speaking the thoughts out to the model.
“Make this look more detailed, darker, lighter, more realistic, more kinetic, more vibrant,” etc. are some of the instructions the user could provide through the new audio interface in response to generations to produce new, adjusted ones that better match their creative vision.
To enter these modes, starting with the new “Draft” feature, the user must first jump through one new hurdle: Midjourney’s personalization feature.
While this feature had been introduced previously on Midjourney v6back in June 2024, it was optional, allowing the user to create a personal “style” that could be applied to all generations going forward by rating 200 pairs of images (selecting which on the user liked best) through the Midjourney website. The user could then toggle on a style that matched the images they liked best during the pairwise rating process.
Now, Midjourney v7 requires users to generate a new v7-specific personalized stylebeforeeven using it at all in the first place.
Once the user does that, they’ll land on the familiar Midjourney Alpha website dashboard where they can click “Create” from the left side rail to open a the creation tab.
Then, in the prompt entry bar at the top, the user can click on the new “P” button to the right of the bar to turn on their personalization mode.
Midjourney founder and leaderDavid Holz confirmed to VentureBeat on Xthat older personalization styles from v6 could also be selected, but not the separate “moodboards” — styles made up of user-uploaded image collections — thoughMidjourney’s X account separately stated that feature will be returning soon as well. However, I didn’t see the opportunity to select my older v6 style.
Nonetheless, the user can then click on the new “Draft Mode” button to the right of the Personalization button (also further to the right of the text prompt entry box) to activate this faster image generation mode.
Once that’s been selected with the cursor, it will turn orange indicating it is turned on, and then a new button with a microphone icon should appear to the right of this one. This is the voice prompting mode, which the user can once again click on to activate.
Once the user has pressed this microphone button to enter the voice prompting mode, they should see the microphone icon change from white to orange to indicate it is engaged, and a waveform line will appear to the right of it that should begin undulating in time with the user’s speech.
The model will then be able to hear you and should also hear when you finish speaking. In practice, I sometimes got an error message saying “Realtime API disconnected,” but stopping and restarting the voice entry mode and refreshing the webpage usually cleared it quickly.
After a few seconds of speaking, Midjourney will begin flashing some keyword windows below the prompt entry textbox at the top and also generate a full text prompt to the right as it generates a new set of 4 images based on what the user said.
The user can then further modify these new generations by speaking to the model again, toggling voice mode on and off as needed.
Here’s a quick demo video of me using it today to generate some sample imagery. You’ll see the process is far from perfect, but it is really fast and does allow for more of an interrupted state of prompting, refining, and receiving images from the model.
Midjourney v7 is launching with two operational modes: Turbo and Relax. Turbo Mode provides high performance at twice the cost of a standard v6 job, while Draft Mode costs half as much (in terms ofjobs). A standard-speed mode is currently in development and will be released once optimized.
At launch, features such as upscaling, inpainting, and retexturing will temporarily rely on the v6 model. Midjourney plans to transition these functions to v7 in future updates.
The company is committing to regular development over the next two months, with updates scheduled every one to two weeks. A major upcoming addition will be a new character and object reference system designed specifically for v7, features found on older versions of Midjourney by applying arcane text prompt suffixes such as –cref and –sref (for style) to tend of a user’s text prompt.
Midjourney plans to engage its community through public sharing spaces and feedback channels, and it will host a roadmap ranking session to help prioritize future development efforts.
Midjourney emphasizes that v7 is a completely new model with its own strengths and challenges. Users are encouraged to experiment with different prompt styles and report their experiences to help refine the platform.
While most of the older Midjourney releases were met with overwhelming excitement and adulation, the initial reception to v7 is decidedly more mixed.
Although Midjourney was careful to call this an “alpha” release in itsblogandon social media, many users still expecting a larger jump in image quality and prompt adherence (how well the image generations matched the user’s specific instructions in text or audio), as well as were hoping for improved human anatomical understanding (particularly of hands, a common AI image generation issue) and text generation (also something image models have struggled with, though Ideogram and OpenAI’s native GPT-4o image generator appear to get it much more consistently accurate than Midjourney v7 based on initial user reports).
As@freiboitar wrote on X:
“Gotta say it: kinda disappointed.OpenAI set the bar sky-high. talk to your image gen like it’s your bro? Mind = blown.
MJ7 looks “more realistic”. but did we really need that?MJ + Magnific already nailed it.
Might pause my sub tbh.”
“The problem is v7 doesn’t really feel like v7. It feels more like v6.2,” postedMagnific AI founder Javi Lopez on X, citing the incremental seeming nature of the updates.
Indeed,Ethan Mollick, the Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business professor and AI influencer, also chimed in to say: “I like their new releases but the problem with the new v7 (right) released today is that v6 (left) was already really good.”
“Identical prompts from v6 are worse in v7,” wrote self-described “AI maximalist”David Shapiro on X.
“All the old Favorites that are getting way too old,” said artist and musician@CaptainHaHaa: “Hands, Text still an issue, no cref, srefs have gone wack. But its ok because you can talk to it while it disappoints you.”
Others were more forgiving and delighted with their initial test generations on v7, with AI power userDreaming Tulpasaying on X it had “better image quality” and was “super artistic.”
Similarly,AI artist and designer Tatiana Tsigulevavoiced that Midjourney v7 was a “Huge jump in quality!”
It’s still early days for Midjourney v7, however, and the initial reaction could swing back in either direction — either adulation or frustration with the new model and design features. For now, it’s available to anyone with a Midjourney account to begin using.

AIart,"Even though MidJourney set out to be one of the most promising image generation models in the early days of AI, it appears to have fallen behind more accessible, easy to use, and free tools such Gemini, ChatGPT, and Bing. Adding to its woes is the latest update to OpenAI’s GPT-4o model which allows exceptionally good image generation with the ability to recreate real photos and produce immaculate text. So to stay relevant — or perhaps catch the hype train being shunted by the wave of Studio Ghibli-inspired AI art flooding the internet, MidJourney is rolling out an updated model with several improvements.
CEO David Holz announced details of the new V7 model on MidJourney’s official Discord server and through a blog post. They said the new model is “smarter with text prompts” and produces images with “noticeably higher” quality and “beautiful textures.”

The model is also capable of generating images in a jiffy, roughly 10 times as fast as the current model, Holz says, as the mode is designed for brainstorming and frequent iterations. You can switch to the Conversational mode (only on web) and recreate part of the image without having to rewrite the prompt entirely or using the Edit mode. The images are of lower quality and cost half of what regular images do.
One of the most exciting new features for our new V7 model is something we call “Draft Mode”. Draft mode is half the cost and 10 times the speed and it might be the best way to iterate on ideas ever. Try it with voice, think out loud and let our ideas flow like liquid dreams. pic.twitter.com/ANfTMC6Ej1 — Midjourney (@midjourney) April 4, 2025
The Conversational mode is substituted by a Voice mode when you use the Discord app on your computer or mobile. Holz says it enables you to “think out loud and let the images flow beneath you like liquid dreams.” This feature is also part of the newly introduced Draft mode.
Additionally, MidJourney V7 can be run in Relax and Turbo modes for high-resolution images (than Draft mode), and using the latter will cost you twice as many credits in exchange for faster image production.
The new V7 model currently lacks some functionality and workflows will default back to the previous V6.1 for tasks that need upscaling, inpainting, and retexturing. Finally, the model also enables Personalization where you can save preferences on how you like your images and expect the model to produce results accordingly. This would require a five-minute setup, which takes you through a series of 200 images that you can choose to tune your preference.",0.9863,positive

AIart,"AI has become quite a contentious topic these past couple years. It seems everyone is rushing at using services like ChatGPT or Midjourney to write scripts or put together videos to watch. These folks all have it backwards: We don’t want the robots making art while we focus on the tedium of our chores. Let’s have the robots do the laborious work we don’t want to do so we have more time to be creative!
Right now, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra robot vacuum and mop is part of a limited time deal knocking off 44% of it’s original price: That brings it down from $1,799 to $999 meaning you can save yourself a crazy $800 and get back so much time to write the next Great American Classic while it cleans your carpets and hardwood floors.
See at Amazon
Why Clean Yourself When a Robot Can Do It For You?
The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is the perfect robot vacuum to end all other robot vacuums: This vac uses a powerful 10,000Pa suction. Pet hair and dirt or debris that lodged deep within your carpet stands no chance and your floors with be left looking pristine after each cleaning session.
This machine is an all-in-one solution: The mop function is able to automatically engage when transitioning from carpet to hardwood floors. The robot can recognize the surface type and height change and enables a 20mm lift function to keep the unit level and prevent your carpets from getting wet in the process. The mop has a rotational speed of 185rpm and a high-speed scrubbing capability of 4000 times per minute to really get into those stubborn stains. You floors will be spotless and with no dampness left behind.
The point of getting a robot vacuum is to save yourself from having to do the chores yourself, so what use is a robot vacuum that you must constantly empty and clean? Well, the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra has a multi-functional docking station.
After cleaning the floors of your home, the robot vacuum and mop will return to its home docking station. There it self-empties automatically, and it even washes and dries itself for you to eliminate the need for manual scrubbing. Plus the hot air drying can prevent unpleasant odors from building up, keeping your home consistently smelling fresh.
If you’re one to occasionally leave something on the floor like a pair of slippers or a book, don’t fret: this Roborock robot vac and mop can navigate around obstacles to avoid an interruptions during its cleaning. It easily maneuvers around furniture, walls, or other objects that might block its path.

AIart,"The use of generative AI in gaming is controversial. Developers need to be minded that gamers can react negatively to AI in finished assets, as we've seen with examples as varied as AI art in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Microsoft's AI Quake II clone.
But AI is more viable when it comes to the earlier stages in game design, speeding up the process of creating storyboards, moodboards and art direction for rough 2D concept rendering.
With that in mind, game development partner Room 8 Group has picked out what it sees as the best AI for game art in a new report (also see our guide to the best game development software to see what programs you might want to pair these with).
The best AI for game art
Room 8 Group's report sets out to find the best AI generator for 2D and concept art. The development parter reviewed 34 AI image generators, including well-known names like Firefly and Midjourney – although those two didn't make it into the top four.
While it gives Midjourney a mention due to its popularity, it warns that game developers with non-disclosure agreements should use Midjourney with caution. It recognises that the model can generate detailed and lifelike images, but argues that it's ""nearly impossible"" to keep the results of Midjourney prompts private.
Room 8 warns that it's important to understand the potential and limitations of generative AI for game art. It sees the role of AI generators as supporting specific stages of the workflow, stressing that the human touch remains central to creativity, final polish and overall quality.
It notes that all models still produced occasional small errors, such as extra fingers and unrealistic physical positions, requiring human intervention in the final stages of development.

01. Stable Diffusion XL
(Image credit: Room 8 Group / AI-generated)
At the top of the list in the report on AI for game art is Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), which Room 8 says produced ""very close to the required level of detail for professional use"". It found SDXL to be faster than other models, making iteration of mulitple variants quicker.
It also praised the model's flexibility, finding that it could be efficiently trained to create images in any style or genre, offering more professional control through Controlnet models, which allow the use of visual references in art generation, while its open-source nature means constant updates from the community.
02. Flux.1 Dev
(Image credit: Room 8 Group / AI-generated)
Flux.1 Dev has become popular due to its photorealism. Indeed, Room 8 found that it gave the best results for image quality and resolution as well as adherence to text prompts. The main reason why it only came in second was because it was slower and more resource-hungry, although the report notes that the model is very flexible when it comes to user training using LoRAs.
03. DALL-E 3
(Image credit: Room 8 Group / AI-generated)
Room 8 praises GPT-4-riven Dall-E 3's ability to generate details, such as poses, lines, and color without requiring direct references. It warns that there's ""no guarantee that Dall-E’s output is legally licensed and safe"", although the same could be said of SDXL and Flux.
04. BRIA
(Image credit: Room 8 Group / AI-generated)
Bria is probably the least known AI image generator on the list. Room 8 says one of its biggest benefits is that it doesn’t require a powerful computer but still allows a lot of customisation of details. And unlike the previous options, it's trained on 100% licensed data.
The downside? It requires custom training to create art ""that’s even halfway good"" and comes with a price tag that can be as high as $7,500 per month. Ouch.

The important thing about Amuse, however, is that it also provides access to generative AI models for all processors, not just AMD. If you have an Intel Core PC with an Nvidia discrete GPU, that’s fine — download the latest Amuse 3.0 version and try its range of capabilities for yourself.
Amuse debuted in 2024 as a collaboration between AMD and TensorStack. In a way, Amuse is AMD’s answer to Intel’s AI Playground, which combines AI art generation with video and integrated LLM chatbots (though video creation didn’t work on AI Playground when I tried it recently). Amuse currently lacks LLM capability, though it can access a number of AI art models — including models explicitly optimized for AMD processors. TensorStack has also added new features: photo filters, local video creation, and AI-powered video generation and restyling, too.
Both Amuse and AI Playground provide an alternative to cloud-based services like Midjourney, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and others which can generate AI art using a powerful server. Amuse runs locally on your PC, which means that you have the privacy to create whatever you want. Amuse does ship with a terms of service that prevents you from making NSFW art, however, as well as some other provisions. Many people dislike AI art, but you’re free to use Amuse to simply see what artificial intelligence can produce.

The advantage for Amuse, however, is that it doesn’t require an AMD Ryzen processor to run it, although AMD does recommend its own hardware. Amuse is designed to work with standalone AMD discrete GPUs like the Radeon 9700 series, but also Ryzen AI 300 notebooks and especially notebooks with AI powerhouse the Ryzen AI Max and its gobs of video RAM. If you own one, Amuse should be one of your first stops in seeking out AI art.
AI art simply works best with more VRAM, and inside Amuse 3.0 you’ll find several AI generation models designed specifically for AMD’s RDNA and XDNA GPUs and NPUs. Specifically, AMD is saying that AMD optimized models can generate images up to 4.3 times faster at FP16 precision on the Radeon 9700 XT, and up to 3.3 times faster on Ryzen AI processors.
Amuse’s performance varies dramatically
AMD recommends that you own either a PC with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 (64GB of RAM), a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 with 32 GB of RAM, or a PC with either a RX 7900 XTX, 7900 XT, 7900 GRE, or 7800 XT GPU. Those aren’t hard-and-fast limits; I tried out the build on two Ryzen AI 365 PCs, one with 32GB of RAM, and one with 24GB of RAM. (I had previously handed over our Asus ROG Flow Z13 (2025) gaming tablet review unit with a Ryzen AI Max+ processor to our video team.)
Both ran, though more RAM translated into higher performance. That’s because you’ll have to manually adjust the available VRAM via AMD’s Adrenalin software or the PC’s BIOS to max out the available VRAM. (Dedicated GPUs don’t have this option.)
AI art generated on a laptop with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 with 32GB of RAM. It still took over four minutes. You’ll really need a discrete GPU of some sort, unless you run it on a model that allows it to be generated by the NPU. Foundry
Measuring performance on an AI art application depends on capable hardware. However, the model itself makes a difference; less sophisticated models execute faster, but generate poorer-quality images. At AMD’s recommendation, I tested out how fast a prompt on Stable Diffusion was, using both the standard model as well as the AMD-optimized version, and the same prompt. The performance improved dramatically; it took Amuse 3.0 and my Ryzen AI 365/32GB laptop 685 seconds (11.42 minutes) to generate just one picture. Using the Ryzen-optimized model, it required just 270 seconds, or 4.5 minutes, meaning that AMD’s estimates weren’t that far off.
That’s still pretty lousy, though. Simply using the default StableDiffusion XL Turbo model, optimized for the Ryzen AI NPU, pumped out four little cartoon raccoons in 37 seconds, and they didn’t look half bad. The model really matters.
Easy, but sophisticated too
As anyone who has used Photoshop or the open-source GNU Image Manipulation Program knows, the power of the application is not just what it can do but how easy it is to use.
Crafting AI art isn’t just coming up with the right description. It requires a good, sophisticated model that can generate realistic images, powerful hardware that can generate art without waiting too long, and a user interface that allows you to get started quickly but also offers more sophisticated adjustments to those who seek it. I liked AI Playground’s simplicity. But Amuse begins in what it calls “EZ Mode,” with just a few options: image generation, image or video filtering, and the ability to “design” art based upon your drawings. The latter is basically Windows’ own Cocreator application.
On a Ryzen machine, Amuse’s EZ-Mode does two things: uses the NPU as an image-generation tool, and then upscales the result. It all saves time and resources, though the guitar in the highlighted image is obviously wrong. Foundry
Like AI Playground, everything is set up to be as simple as possible; if Amuse needs to download something, it will simply explain why, tell you how much space it will consume, then ask for your permission.
A small button down in the lower left-hand corner advertises “expert mode,” which unlocks more advanced features. Here, you can download more of the AMD-optimized models that AMD makes available. (They’re handily labeled with AMD logos.) You can also select multiple models for image or video generation.
The Expert model allows you to move back and forth between these models for image generation. (You’ll have to manually load in each one, like swapping out a DVD in the player.) The search could be improved, however, as it’s not immediately obvious which models need to be downloaded for use with video generation.
Amuse generates images, which can be saved, edited, or upscaled, or used as the genesis for AI-generated video, too. Unlike some tools, like Adobe Firefly, Amuse does not label the images as AI-generated.

I honestly was not impressed with many of the AI images that the models generated, whether I used the “standard” Stable Diffusion models or the versions optimized for AI. There’s a lot Amuse offers to allow you to tweak the output, however, and it’s worth playing with it to see what works for you.
I liked Amuse’s text-to-video capabilities, however. At least on the models I selected, the default resolution was just 512×512, with just enough keyframes to produce a few seconds of video. I didn’t want to destroy my laptop, so I opted not to push it to its limits (with “HD” video of 1024×1024 as well as several minutes of length.).
But the imagery was largely coherent, and delivered what I asked for, generally — unless I pushed it above 10 seconds or so. Then it was clear that the generated art had been fashioned from several clips, and not always of the same thing. Some of the competing cloud-based models, such as Sora, or Google’s Veo, look more cohesive.

Is Amuse good? Yeah, and for everyone
Compared to Amuse, Intel’s AI Playground feels a bit more simplistic, a bit more limited, but also a bit more welcoming. It’s a good tool for seeing what AI has to offer, though it’s limited to a subset of Intel processors. The Amuse app is definitely more for enthusiasts, but the user interface doesn’t feel especially overwhelming. Just keep in mind that the app may offer capabilities that go beyond what you want to do with it, such as feature extraction.
Amuse isn’t perfect; I’d like it’s “EZ Mode” to offer a bit more direction into more advanced features, without the need to seek out the “Expert Mode” to the lower right. Likewise, I’d like to see a few more tooltips or assistance into understanding what some of the more advanced features can do. But Amuse is free, installs quickly, and allows you access to specialized models for AMD Ryzen processors without limiting you to them.
Even better, you don’t need to be a Ryzen owner to use it. That elevates Amuse into one of the better AI art app suites, period.",0.9998,positive
AIart,"At first glance, the AI-generated Studio Ghibli trend seems harmless—playful even. Picture-perfect landscapes rendered in the signature Ghibli palette, large eyes, curious, childlike expressions, cute animals. But spend more than a few seconds with them, and the cracks start to show. These machine-crafted tributes, while visually faithful, are emotionally vacant. They skim the surface, offering snapshots with none of the spirit. There’s beauty in the mimicry, sure, but something’s missing. Hayao Miyazaki himself once called AI “an insult to life itself,” and if you’ve ever watched his films, you know exactly what he meant. His stories are born from brush strokes, sweat, stubbornness, and a spiritual bond between nature and humanity—things no algorithm can replicate.
That’s why the “World of Studio Ghibli” LEGO set feels like such a poetic counterpoint. Created by LEGO Ideas member janrssx, this 4,200-piece tribute doesn’t try to synthesize Ghibli’s soul through code. Instead, it builds it—brick by brick, scene by scene, with the kind of tactile craftsmanship Miyazaki would probably smile at, begrudgingly or not. Where AI reduces, this set reimagines—through tangible effort, human hands, and a lot of nerdy love.
Designer: janrssx
This MOC (My Own Creation) from janrssx is truly a diorama of Ghibli’s greatest cinematic hits. Nausicaä hovers over the Toxic Jungle with her glider, a Giant Warrior’s skull lurking beneath. The Laputian robot from Castle in the Sky sits peacefully near Pazu and Sheeta’s cave, its vines and rust telling a story of time and tenderness. The Catbus and Soot Sprites dance around Totoro and Satsuki with a kind of whimsical logic only Ghibli fans will instinctively understand.
From Spirited Away, Chihiro stands next to a lovingly crafted No-Face, while the Sea Railway stretches through the set like a dream you half-remember. The bathhouse façade opens to reveal piggery chambers and ghostly side characters, all rendered in miniature with absurd detail. And then there’s Howl’s Moving Castle, clunking along in its chaotic beauty—complete with rooms you can actually peek into. Howl, Sophie, and Turnip Head are all here, ready for some real-time mischief.
Even lesser-celebrated entries like Porco Rosso and Ponyo get their due. Porco’s crimson plane soars across a backdrop of LEGO clouds, while Ponyo perches on the edge of her watery world, a tiny piece of oceanic wonder suspended in mid-brick. Every corner of this build invites discovery. Kodama from Princess Mononoke peek out from the trees near San’s cave, where Moro rests in eternal watchfulness. It’s a shrine to Ghibli storytelling, designed with obsessive love and unflinching detail.
The build features 10 regular minifigures and weaves scenes from eight films into a single cohesive landscape. Unlike the more modular style of some LEGO sets, this one feels like a living tapestry. Each section flows organically into the next, capturing that ethereal, dream-walking sensation Ghibli films are famous for. And like those films, the LEGO set rewards those who slow down. Look closer, and you’ll find tiny rooms tucked behind Spirit Realm gates, Jiji peeking from Kiki’s bakery window, or soot sprites hiding under Totoro’s umbrella stand.
janrssx’s creation reached the 10K supporter mark—no surprise, really—and now awaits that final golden nod from LEGO. Should it be made real, it could sit comfortably alongside the best of LEGO’s licensed releases, offering fans something AI could never manufacture: emotional depth built by hand. It channels that quiet, soulful philosophy Miyazaki infused into every frame, now expressed through ABS plastic and a little builder’s magic.
Where AI gives us an echo, this set gives us something to hold, to marvel at, to build. A physical connection to stories that taught us to care—about nature, spirit, and each other.",0.9979,positive
AIart,"Midjourney has just launched its newest AI image-generation model, V7. This updated version seems to grasp your text prompts more effectively. It looks like it is producing images that are not only of higher quality but also more cohesive. The Midjourney team says that V7 comes with better textures and does a much better job at capturing intricate details, especially when it comes to things like hands and bodies.
What Are the New Features?
Midjourney has featured something that looks pretty exciting in their V7 update. It is called “Draft Mode.” I would say it seems beneficial if you’re into quick prototyping. You might generate images at half the usual speed, and it’ll only cost you half as much. The results might be a little unrefined—there’s not as much polish or detail.
Therefore, this mode seems perfect for quickly brainstorming ideas. Sometimes you might be collaborating with a partner or maybe feel a bit uncertain about what aesthetic you’re desiring for. Draft Mode is designed for that chaotic creative process. It even supports voice prompts. This means you can share and develop your ideas without the hassle of typing everything out. If you find something interesting on Draft Mode, you can click on “enhance” or “vary,” and Midjourney will create a high-quality AI generated version for you.
As soon as V7 will launch, it will have two options for rendering: Turbo and Relax. Turbo might deliver your images quickly, but it will be double the price of a regular render from V6. In contrast, Relax mode seems more budget-friendly, though you’ll have to wait a bit longer for your results. As for regular-speed rendering, it’s not available yet. I think that they still need time to improve that feature for V7. So, lets just be little patient.
It’s important to know that there are some things V7 can’t handle at this time. It won’t be doing upscaling, editing, or retexturing right now; those functions will still be managed by the older V6 version.
Another important thing is personalization that Midjourney V7 focuses on. It might ask you to rate about 200 images. This seems to give the AI a better understanding of your aesthetic preference, so it can create visuals that match your taste more closely. You might easily turn this personalization option on or off in the Midjourney web app.
What it Means for Creators?
Personally, I think Midjourney V7 is making some serious progress in the world of AI creativity. It seems to grasp text prompts, tailor good results, and provide quicker rendering options with this new launch.
I think the Draft Mode is a great addition recently. Sometimes inspiration strikes, but you’re not quite ready to finalize everything. In this regard, this tool seems magical to me because it allows you to explore those rough ideas. It can be either working on slower drafts or using voice commands.
I know there are still some limitations. You can’t upscale or edit at this point, and normal-speed rendering is not available. But it’s okay since this is just an alpha version. So, expect frequent updates and enhancements based on user feedback.

AIart,"Big day for AI image nerds: Midjourney just released the long-awaited V7 Alpha, and yes — it’s finally here after almost a year of silence on major updates.
If you’ve been itching for better image quality, faster generation, and some genuinely cool new tools, V7 Alpha might be your new favorite toy.
First off, the image quality is noticeably sharper. V7 Alpha brings better textures, more accurate object details, bodies (hands included, finally), and just an all-around more polished feel. It’s the kind of jump that makes you want to go back and redo all your old prompts.

This version also introduces personalization by default. That means Midjourney wants to get to know you a bit — you’ll rate around 200 images to help it learn your style.
After that, the results are more in line with your aesthetic, which honestly feels like the AI equivalent of a personal stylist.
One of the biggest new features is Draft Mode, and it’s pretty slick. It’s ten times faster and costs half as much as the regular mode. The images are lower-res at first, but you can upscale them with a single click. Oh, and get this — you can talk to it. Yep, Draft Mode supports voice prompts. Just speak your image into existence like it’s magic.
“It’s so fast that we change the prompt bar to a ‘conversational mode’ when you’re using it on web. Tell it to swap out a cat with an owl or make it night time and it will automatically manipulate the prompt and start a new job. Click ‘draft mode’ then the microphone button to enable ‘voice mode’ – where you can think out loud and let the images flow beneath you like liquid dreams.”
Now that MidJourney V7 is out, here are some images I made.
So far, it seems like V7 outputs a lot of detail and fairly good composition.

Not everything made it into the Alpha. Features like upscaling and retexturing aren’t supported yet, but Midjourney says they’re coming in the next couple of months. So if you’re missing some of your usual tools, hang tight — they’re on the way.
Midjourney says they’re planning to drop new features every week or two for the next 60 days. That includes a character and object reference system — something a lot of creators have been begging for.
All in all, this is a huge leap for Midjourney. With V7 Alpha, they’re not just catching up to the competition — they’re trying to leapfrog it.

AIart,"Midjourney released its latest V7 model last week and already users have been inputting creative prompts that include a filename from a camera system to achieve photorealistic AI images.
One X user, who goes by Min Choi, published a thread of images in which he writes a generic camera filename before a descriptive prompt. Choi chose CR2, Canon’s previous generation RAW image file format. For example, Choi used the prompt “IMG_7249.CR2” followed by “casual selfie at X.”
The results are astonishing, producing images that are almost impossible to detect as synthetic.

It’s not just Canon filenames either, Levi Forster used the iPhone image format HEIC, in his Midjourney prompt.
“AI is trained on photos,” Forster explains. “Many real photos have file names like IMG_02202021.HEIC — so if you feed it just a typical file name in the prompt and that’s it, it will generate a realistic looking picture because the data that corresponds is always real.”

A Reddit user has been trying out this method for the last few months in a bid to create realistic looking photos on the AI image generator.
“CR2 file is a RAW image file format created by Canon digital cameras,” the Reddit user explains. “The name CR2 stands for Canon Raw 2. The number part I’ve just made up so you can mess around with the numbers but just make sure it’s in that order.”
Users can simply enter a generic camera filename in the prompt, nothing else, and Midjourney will come back with “something random.”
Meanwhile, other users have praised the new model’s “base level realism”, showing off photorealistic examples.

Midjourney was once at the forefront of AI image generators — a controversial new industry that encroaches on the photography space — having been a very early product. However, it seemingly doesn’t have the influence it once did.
Perhaps that is because Midjourney is, as Tech Crunch describes, an “unusual company” since it has never raised any outside money. Or perhaps it is because of the lawsuits it is facing.

“V7 is much smarter with text prompts,” Holz says in an announcement on Discord. “Image prompts look fantastic, image quality is noticeably higher with beautiful textures, and bodies, hands, and objects of all kinds have significantly better coherence on all details.”
There are still features rolling out to V7, such as image upscaling and retexturing. These will arrive in the coming months.

AIart,"Earlier this week, OpenAI released their “most advanced image generator yet” and made it available through ChatGPT using the GPT-4o model. ChatGPT previously relied on Dall-E to generate images.
According to OpenAI, the improved 4o model is able to produce precise, accurate, and photorealistic results. They claim that it’s also particularly good at rendering text, following instructions precisely, and even understanding the context of a chat. All of this includes the transformation of uploaded images or using uploaded images as visual inspiration.

GPT-4o can also continually build on existing images to ensure the subject remains consistent across images. On top of that, GPT-4o is now able to handle 10 to 20 different objects in images (compared to most other AI image generators, which struggle to include 5 to 8 different objects).
At the same time, OpenAI warns that GPT-4o may have problems with cropping, hallucinations, too many elements, precise graphs, rendering text in non-Latin alphabets, precise editing, and displaying lots of dense text on a small surface.

OpenAI may have kicked off the text-to-image generation craze with its DALL-E model, but since those earlier glory days, the AI company's offering has been lapped by much more capable image models. As a result, when OpenAI released its latest and greatest GPT-4o image generation model, I was skeptical. After testing it, I have changed my mind entirely.
Getting started
When DALL-E first launched, it lived on its standalone website; since then, it has moved to ChatGPT. The move came with many benefits, including the ability to ask the AI chatbot for an image you want in the same interface where you are already chatting about something else, thereby eliminating the need for constant context switching.
With the release of GPT-4o image generation, OpenAI kept this convenient format, switching the default image generator from DALL-E to GPT-4o for paid subscribers. As a result, it was super easy to start creating new images from my ChatGPT Plus account. All I had to do was enter the prompt for what I wanted to see, and then it generated them. Users can also access it from the Sora interface.
Also: How to use OpenAI's Sora to create stunning AI-generated videos
You can also generate images if you are a free user. At launch, the model was announced to be coming to all users, including free ones, but then OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a day later that the rollout to the free tier would now be ""delayed for awhile,"" only to make it available to free users again a week later.
However, if you are unimpressed when you try it in the free version, it is because the only method that activates the use of GPT-4o is typing in the shortcut ""/create image."" If you simply type a request such as ""Create an image of XYZ,"" it will default to the DALL-E model, which renders significantly lower-quality photos. OpenAI does not explicitly state limits, but after generating three images from my free account, I hit my daily limit. Therefore, ChatGPT Plus is still a good option for higher access to image generation.
The images
The moment you have been waiting for -- the images. After you insert a prompt, the AI outputs the generation in under a minute. The process does take a bit longer than it used to, but the images are worth the wait, delivering lots of details, texture, realism, and even text accuracy. Instead of describing it, I will include examples below so you can see for yourself.
Prompt: Can you generate a realistic image of a chameleon, up close, shot as if it were in National Geographic in 16:9 ratio?

Prompt: Can you generate an image of a laptop open on a desk that says, ""This model is so good that it can even get text and hands right, which are usually major challenges for AI models,"" with hands typing on a keyboard in 16:9 ratio?

Prompt: Can you generate a realistic photo of a close-up of a woman in a crowd in Times Square looking at the camera and smiling, with the quality of one taken on a DSLR?
Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET via ChatGPT
As seen above, the image generator does a great job of adhering to the prompt and delivering high-quality, realistic images. However, when testing an AI model, one of the true performance metrics is how it compares to competitors on the market. To give you a good indicator of this, I made it generate the same prompt I tested across all of the major AI image generators, including Midjourney, Google's Imagen 3, Adobe Firefly, and more.
I am attaching GPT-4o's rendition below. You can see how it fares against all of the other AI image generators in this article, including DALL-E's rendition, which clearly is far behind what the new model can do.
Prompt: Can you generate an image of a vibrant, realistic hummingbird perched on a tree?
Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET via ChatGPT
Other notable features
Even though the quality of the images is perhaps one of the model's biggest wins, there are other benefits as well. One of the biggest is that it lives in the chatbot's interface, which makes it easy to tweak the generations with simple natural language prompts. Also, because the chatbot has the context of what you just asked it, it can consider that in building the image.
For example, if you are chatting with it about throwing a birthday party, you may be able to say, ""Can you now create an invite that has the information above on it?"" instead of having to retype. For example, I started chatting with ChatGPT about throwing a housewarming, and when asking it to create an invite, I did not have to repeat the information I previously provided.
Screenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET
You can also upload reference images and then ask ChatGPT to create a different version or use them as elements of a new one. For example, you can input it as a selfie and have it generated in anime style, as seen in Altman's new X post.
All of these customization features make it a really strong offering for creatives, who can also request that it be rendered on a transparent background or incorporate brand style guides such as hex codes or logos.
Speaking of Altman, I was able to generate an image of him wearing a party hat. I could do so because the new model has much looser safeguards, meant to allow users to lean into their creative freedom. The blog post announcing the model noted that it limits what can be created when real people are in the context, including ""particularly robust safeguards around nudity and graphic violence.""

I cannot tell if there is a practical use case for this feature, but it is a notable change I needed to try out for myself. When I tried to create an image of Mickey Mouse, it said it could not due to copyright implications, so it seems not all public figures are fair game.
Overall
Overall, the GPT-4o image generator is a big win over the DALL-E models and perhaps among the best of the many I have tested. Is it worth the $20 per month? If you are just interested in high-quality image generation, there are still free versions you can explore that are really capable, such as Adobe Firefly or Google's Imagen 3.
Also: The best AI image generators: Tested and reviewed
Having said this, the updated image generation features are rolling out now, and all users, including free ones, can access them. However, free users must type the shortcut ""/create image,"" or else the system defaults to the lower-quality DALL-E model.
If you are a frequent ChatGPT user, the upgrade to ChatGPT Plus becomes significantly more enticing. You will have access to all of OpenAI's latest and greatest chatbot features, as well as high-quality image and video generation, all for $20 a month, which is not a bad deal, especially considering other offerings on the market. For example, Midjourney's subscription starts at $10 per month and only offers image generation.

AIart,"Last month, OpenAI launched a new AI image generator, powered by its GPT-4o model, by showing off its ability to turn any image into one inspired by iconic Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli. The new functionality quickly kicked off a viral trend that had everyone from the White House to Israel Defense Forces Ghibli-fying images. It also kicked off a major public backlash, given that Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki, famously committed to hand-drawn animation, once called AI-generated art “an insult to life itself.”
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has finally responded to the criticism. Appearing on a YouTube podcast with Indian entrepreneur Varun Mayya on Sunday, Altman characterized AI art generators as a “democratization” of art creation.
“I think the democratization of creating content has been a big net win for society. It has not been a complete win, there are negative things about it for sure, and certainly it did something about the art form, but I think on the whole it’s been a win,” Altman said.
Altman’s sentiment is unsurprising, as it’s seemingly been the company line for AI boosters on X, Reddit, and other major social media platforms since Midjourney, OpenAI’s DALL-E 2, and Stable Diffusion were released to the public in 2022. (It’s worth noting that sentiment is largely absent on Bluesky, whose user base has been widely anti-AI.)
In the podcast, Altman goes on to say that while there might be “job loss” due to the rise of AI art, he believes that lowering barriers to participation and creating more “competition” by allowing people of “differential abilities” to create is “a real benefit to society.”
That argument only really works if you believe generative-AI art is actually good. At least for the moment, the verdict is no. The art produced by these tools have been described as being strangely uniform in aesthetic, lacking in emotion or intent, and, at the very least, deeply unsettling. (That’s without getting into the philosophical argument over what the purpose of art produced without humans even is.)
Unfortunately, “good” or bad” may soon be besides the point. Low-quality “AI slop” is already crowding out human content across social media platforms, with one recent study finding that over half of long-form posts on LinkedIn are AI-generated. Meanwhile, another study from researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found that test subjects were unable to distinguish between AI-generated poems and those by canonical bards like William Shakespeare, Lord Byron, Emily Dickinson, and T.S. Eliot. Participants thought the AI-generated poems were more likely to be written by a human, rating those poems more favorably than those by the actual authors. It’s a bleak state of affairs.
In the interview with Maya, Altman suggested that the benefits to lowering the barriers to entry for art would be similar to the ease associated with starting a company since the advent of the internet. But Altman’s analogy, where he argues OpenAI would have impossible in another era, elides one critical point. OpenAI was founded in 2015 by some of the most powerful people in tech, including Elon Musk, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Paypal founder (and major right-wing funder) Peter Thiel, and Altman, who was then the president of Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s most famous tech accelerator. It’s more than a little absurd to describe OpenAI, as Altman does, as a “ragtag bunch.”
The current debate over AI-generated art produced by OpenAI and its competitors is unfortunate in no small part because there is a long history of artists using AI and machine learning to interesting effect—see Harold Cohen’s AARON, which dates back to the early ’70s. Today, there are numerous artists leveraging those tools to explore aspects of contemporary society, the nature of consciousness, and the underlying logic of such technologies, among other topics.
Much of that work was on display last month in Hong Kong, where Singaporean artist Ho Tzu Nyen explored the limits and dangers of nostalgia by creating a custom generator using classic Hong Kong films, while Chinese artist Lin Jingjing crafted a AI artist avatar for a series of paintings that suggest a more fluid idea of authorship. Key to those works—and those by other artists working in similar modes—however, is both a clarity of intent and a deep engagement with the tools themselves that goes far beyond entering a prompt like “Rembrandt painting, Ghibli style.”
AI enthusiasts, meanwhile, have suggested that Miyazaki’s quote, which comes from a 2016 documentary on Japanese television, was taken out of context and misunderstood. Here’s the fuller context, per Indiewire:
After seeing a brief demo of a grotesque zombie-esque creature, Miyazaki pauses and says that it reminds him of a friend of his with a disability so severe he can’t even high five. “Thinking of him, I can’t watch this stuff and find [it] interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is whatsoever. I am utterly disgusted. If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it. I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.”
Miyazaki’s stance seems pretty unambiguous to me.",0.9555,positive

Midjourney has announced a new image model, V7, that is rolling out in alpha starting today. This new model, according to Midjourney, brings better image quality with ""beautiful textures,"" better coherence for things like hands and objects, among others. The model ships with two modes, Turbo and Relax, with Turbo costing more than twice as much as regular V6 mode.
There's also a new feature called ""Draft mode,"" which costs half as much as standard mode while rendering images ten times faster.
There are two ways to use Draft mode. The first involves clicking ""draft mode,"" then ""voice mode"" and speaking your ideas. The second involves using the --draft flag right after your prompt.
Images generated with Draft mode are lower quality compared to standard mode. If you see something you like in Draft mode, you can click ""enhance"" or ""vary"" on the image to render it in full quality.
Tasks like mood boards and Style Reference Codes (SREF) work with V7, while for tasks like upscaling, editing, and retexturing, V6 models will be used. Availability in V7 models is slated for the future.
If you're interested in V7, keep in mind that you must unlock your personalization to use it since the model ships with personalization turned on by default. In Midjourney, personalization means the AI learns your style and preferences over time. Instead of just generating random images based on your prompts, it tries to match what you like.
To make this work, you have to rank at least 200 pairs of images. The whole process takes five minutes. This helps the AI understand your taste. Once that’s done, you can turn personalization on or off anytime.
Midjourney has come a long way since it was founded by David Holz back in 2022. In its early days, the platform ran entirely on Discord, meaning you'd have to be part of the Midjourney Discord server to generate images with its models. If Discord's not your thing, the official website is available, though you'd need a subscription.
Midjourney faces tough competition from AI labs like OpenAI, which recently launched a viral new image generation tool that is very good at rendering text, a common weakness for image generation models. OpenAI's new tool is so good that some users have discovered you can use it to generate fake receipts.",0.9727,positive
AIart,"AI is here, it’s loud, and it’s got Opinions™ on your workflow. One minute you only use models like Midjourney for “inspiration.” Next thing you know, your client is asking if you can “just use ChatGPT to make that website copy or bit of social content.” Designers: here’s the uncanny valley of creative automation. It’s shiny. It’s fast. It’s kind of terrifying. Especially when Bill Gates says only 3 jobs are safe from it.
Let’s get one thing out of the way: AI tools can be incredibly useful. Adobe Firefly, Copilot, even those cursed Figma plugins — they can speed up the boring stuff. Need a mood board? Boom. Need 20 logo variations? Here you go. Want to see what an Elk looks with spaghetti earrings in the style of Thomas Gainsborough? Don’t ask why - just type it in, and you got it. (Hoop, dangle or stud?)
Tools like Adobe Firefly can be useful for ideation (Image credit: Adobe/Future)
But here’s the thing: while AI can spit out something, it can’t tell you what’s good. It doesn’t understand nuance. It doesn’t care about brand or emotional equity. That’s your job.
Worse, the more we rely on AI, the more everything starts looking… the same. Prompt in, bland out. Scroll Instagram for five minutes and you’ll see what I mean: a million slightly-different AI logos and surreal renderings of floating people with extra fingers.
It can be for fun, for sure, replacing smiling family members with dog heads, but it’s not work, it’s not professional, It’s the visual equivalent of a dry-bone sandwich brought at the petrol station. Technically food, but is it nourishing for the body or soul?
Why do all AI logos look the same? (Image credit: Eyeware/OpenAI/DeepMotion)
And then there’s the ethical stuff. Most of these AI models were trained on yours or other people's work (and weirdly enough on its own work - through training on and amplifying its own AI-generated content that is already flooding). And all without consent. While you were out there trying to make some kind of career, someone was scraping your Behance portfolio into a dataset, and now it’s being sold back to you.
Add to that the loss of creative fulfillment, the legal grey zones, and the looming fear that your next job interview will involve prompt engineering rather than sketching, and yeah — there are pitfalls (maybe pitfalls is the biggest under exaggeration ever given the industry changing potential of the tech - but more on that another time).

So what do we do? What can we do? We use AI, but don’t marry it. Let it be the admin assistant, not the boss or the creative. Use it to explore, iterate, and play, have fun with it but keep the human in the loop. Your instincts, taste, ethics, and experience are still the sharpest tools in the box. In short: AI can make the work faster, but only you can make it matter.",0.9951,positive
AIart,"The new model makes progress on technical issues that have plagued AI image generators for years. While most have been great at creating fantastical images or realistic deepfakes, they’ve been terrible at something called binding, which refers to the ability to identify certain objects correctly and put them in their proper place (like a sign that says “hot dogs” properly placed above a food cart, not somewhere else in the image).
It was only a few years ago that models started to succeed at things like “Put the red cube on top of the blue cube,” a feature that is essential for any creative professional use of AI. Generators also struggle with text generation, typically creating distorted jumbles of letter shapes that look more like captchas than readable text.

Example images from OpenAI show progress here. The model is able to generate 12 discrete graphics within a single image—like a cat emoji or a lightning bolt—and place them in proper order. Another shows four cocktails accompanied by recipe cards with accurate, legible text. More images show comic strips with text bubbles, mock advertisements, and instructional diagrams.

AIart,"Recently, there has been a major influx of AI-generated Studio Ghibli-esque pictures because of OpenAI’s new GPT‑4o image generator. It creates photos in the animation studio’s signature style and transforms existing pictures into that style. I know, I know…it’s absolutely bonkers and a little…a lot…scary. The virality of AI animation and art right now has sparked the resurfacing of anti-AI comments from Hayao Miyazaki. Below is the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, announcing and demonstrating the new features that reignited this discussion.
we are launching a new thing today—images in chatgpt!
two things to say about it:
1. it's an incredible technology/product. i remember seeing some of the first images come out of this model and having a hard time they were really made by AI. we think people will love it, and we… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 25, 2025
The full text of the Tweet, which alludes to the ability of the AI to create Studio Ghibli art in Hayao Miyazaki’s style, reads:
we are launching a new thing today—images in chatgpt! two things to say about it: 1. it’s an incredible technology/product. i remember seeing some of the first images come out of this model and having a hard time they were really made by AI. we think people will love it, and we are excited to see the resulting creativity. congrats to our researchers 2. this represents a new high-water mark for us in allowing creative freedom. people are going to create some really amazing stuff and some stuff that may offend people; what we’d like to aim for is that the tool doesn’t create offensive stuff unless you want it to, in which case within reason it does. as we talk about in our model spec, we think putting this intellectual freedom and control in the hands of users is the right thing to do, but we will observe how it goes and listen to society. we think respecting the very wide bounds society will eventually choose to set for AI is the right thing to do, and increasingly important as we get closer to AGI. thanks in advance for the understanding as we work through this.
Altman’s profile picture is also himself in Studio Ghibli’s artform, no doubt made by AI. Altman essentially kicked off this recent trend of people Studio Ghiblifying everything from their selfies to memes. With the attention on the legendary studio’s art style, co-founder Hayao Miyazaki’s previous anti-AI comments are in the spotlight again.
Studio Ghibli
In 2016, in a documentary aired by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation called NHK Special: Hayao Miyazaki – The One Who Never Ends, Miyazaki was shown an AI-generated character. The character was a scary monster that used its head as a leg because it couldn’t feel pain. The person presenting it said its movements could be used in making a zombie video game.
Miyazaki responded by saying that AI-generated artwork was “an insult to life itself” and that he’d never include it in his Studio Ghibli work or otherwise:
Every morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability. It’s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can’t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can’t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is. I’m utterly disgusted. If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it. I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.

The people who created and presented the technology to Miyazaki said their end goal was to create an AI machine that could draw like humans. This was back in 2016, only nine years ago. Technically, the world has made progress on that claim. However, in order for a machine to function anything exactly like humans, a certain level of imperfection needs to occur. Unintentional error shows humanity. The machine would also require a strong personal history that informs how it perceives things. These two things usually convey the strongest levels of emotion from art.
Miyazaki went on to say, “I feel like we are nearing to the end of the times. We humans are losing faith in ourselves.” This powerful testament still holds relevance almost a decade after Miyazaki said it. I think we can all relate to Miyazaki’s thoughts on the advent of generative AI. Although Miyazaki hasn’t said anything recently, other people in entertainment, like the daughter of Robin Williams, Zelda Williams, spoke out on Instagram.
NHK
“People are gleefully sharing ‘Studio Ghibli style’ AI memes and photos, as though the man himself wouldn’t absolutely despise the technological piracy and negative effects on our environment, said Williams. “Anyway, go watch Princess Mononoke in theaters tonight, and **** AI, she continued referring the film’s recent rerelease in theatres in IMAX 4K.
Generative AI keeps getting better and more accurate with every update, but as a society, we need to work toward its regulation and responsible usage. It definitely has a place in our future, and even if we don’t know where the limits are now, we need to figure it out soon. We need to make sure it works with artists, not against them. And please, honor the wishes of Miyazaki and do not create any Studio Ghibli AI knock-offs.",0.9963,positive

AIart,"McDonald's Mexico is in the spotlight after unwisely jumping on an AI art trend that's got everyone talking. Last week, everyone was using AI to make Studio Ghibli-style memes out of well known images – with the boundaries between good and poor taste blurred in many cases (I'm looking at you, whoever made the one of the Twin Towers). Given Studio Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki famously hates AI art generation, the whole thing was on shaky ground from the start. Add to that the sheer number of people that got involved, and the types of images that were being published and you've got a perfect storm.
The Mexican branch of McDonald's created its own Studio Ghibli-style memes and shared them on social media, which though not as shocking as others in content was still a bad move. Using Studio Ghibli's signature style to advertise without permission is not a good look for a global fast food giant. Not every trend needs to be jumped on – maybe the social media team should have used the best digital art software to make something more reputable.
Posted by McDonaldsMexico on
The post on McDonald's Facebook, which shows a family and individuals enjoying McDonald's food (see it above) has gathered hundreds of disparaging comments calling the chain out for stealing Studio Ghibli's IP, and for using AI to create art. ""What happened McDonald's? isn't it enough to pay a real artist?"" asks one user. ""Unbelievable, one thing is one person uses it but a multi billion dollar company?"" reflects another.
""I hope you get sued,"" one comment says, leading to a debate underneath about whether you can sue someone for basing AI work on your artstyle. This is possibly one of the most important debates around at the moment as many artists' works are being emulated via AI art generators – and whether you're protected depends on which country you're in. IN the EU/UK, copyright protects art but not style. If an artist can prove an AI model was trained on their artwork then copyright could kick in.
Nonetheless, this Facebook post is in bad taste for a huge corporation. Surprisingly, after being published a couple of days ago the post is still live on Facebook. This is even after huge amounts of publicity surrounding the Studio Ghibli trend and the overwhelmingly negative response.
McDonald's Japan and Studio Ghibli have collaborated in the past, with the Kiki's Delivery Service-themed campaign last year so seeing McDonald's in this style is not unprecedented. However, with no permission and the use of AI, it's hard to see how a positive relationship could be forged between the Mexican branch of McDonald's and Studio Ghibli.

In brief: Midjourney recently launched a new version of its generative artificial intelligence service that makes it almost impossible to distinguish digital creations from real photos, especially when leveraging a clever prompt trick.
Over on X, user Min Choi shared a series of images created with Midjourney v7 using a simple but effective hack. By appending a generic camera filename to the input prompt, Choi was able to consistently generate photo-realistic images.
According to Choi, these 100 percent AI-generated people are not real. Presumably, the images are straight out of the AI and have not been doctored in any way. Try as I might, I was unable to detect any anomalies in the samples. Can you spot any AI glitches?
Wow. Midjourney v7 is wild.
These people aren't real
100% AI🤯
10 wild examples:
1. IMG_7249.CR2 casual selfie at home pic.twitter.com/7pgRrnKxgu – Min Choi (@minchoi) April 6, 2025
As PetaPixel highlights, generative AI programs like Midjourney are trained on real photos and many of them have default filename formats. CR2, like Choi leveraged, is Canon's last-gen RAW image format. Adding text like ""IMG_7384.CR2"" to an AI prompt along with ""casual selfie at [chosen location]"" seemingly tricks the system into generating incredibly lifelike images.
Interestingly enough, it is also possible to enter a filename into Midjourney v7 without an additional prompt and get something totally random reach time.
The trick isn't limited to Canon's image format, as others were also successful in using the HEIC extension to create photorealistic pictures.
Worth noting is the fact that the filename trick is not new. Several months ago, a Reddit user shared several images created in an earlier version of Midjourney using a similar filename prompt. These weren't of people, but the results were still rather impressive.
Midjourney version 7 is available now. According to the company's description, it affords richer textures and more coherent details – especially in bodies, hands, and objects. The update additionally introduces Draft Mode, a way to prototype images at 10x the speed and at half the GPU cost.

Grove Gallery Alexandra Johnson has sold her works for tens of thousands of pounds
Alexandra Johnson was already grieving her mother's death when Covid-19 hit the UK in 2020. As a former city trader, she had no formal art qualifications, but she nonetheless decided to manage the boredom and channel her grief by painting in her kitchen. The mother-of-three has gone on to sell her works - painted exclusively with a palette knife and spatula - for five-figure sums. Earlier this month, her portrait of Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai sold for £51,200 at the prestigious Bonhams auction house. ""I always go for powerful women, not for [their] jobs and career, just for their inner strength,"" said Johnson, who lives in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.
Grove Gallery Johnson said she found inspiration in Malala Yousafzai, a young woman who was shot by the Taliban for going to school
Johnson left her job as a trader in 2002 to become a full-time mum. She became a full-time carer for her own mother in 2017 after her cancer diagnosis, and Janet died in February 2019. The 53-year-old recalled how ""we were really bored"" when the first lockdown was imposed and she was still ""fresh in grief"". ""I don't think I'd spent five hours painting [at that point] but during lockdown the pace of life had become a lot slower,"" she told the BBC. ""I wanted to see how good I could be."" Her ""amazing"" mother served as an ""inspiration"" for those early paintings. Janet had already sacrificed her own health by giving a kidney to one of her brothers when she was 60 years old.

art,"At the Pace gallery in Chelsea in early April, the artist and musician David Byrne was in a stairwell, lying on the floor and drawing on the wall with a black acrylic marker. Byrne, who is seventy-two, wore a buttoned-up navy polo shirt, a white wristwatch, and railroad-striped overalls. (“I thought, I have to dress like an artist today,” he said.) He finished inking a foot, said, “O.K., we’ve got hands to draw,” stood, and admired his creation: a mural showing a family of four with humanoid bodies—soft curves, rumpled clothes, neatly folded hands—and skyscrapers for heads. Byrne, who lives nearby, had been drawing in the stairwell all day. He was working from sketches he’d made, which Nate Kamp, an exhibition manager, projected onto the walls. Byrne finished the hands on a skyscraper-headed child, then asked, “What’s the next one? Oh, the one with the eyes?”
“I think the Eyes, yeah,” Kamp said.
“Whoa, boy,” Byrne said, in a here-we-go tone. He picked up a wooden stool and proceeded down to a third-floor landing.
Pace, founded by Arne Glimcher in 1960, and now run by his son Marc, opened its eight-story flagship building, designed by Bonetti/Kozerski Architecture, in 2019. Beauty and art abound—that day, Robert Indiana number sculptures adorned a sixth-floor terrace—but only recently in the stairwell. “I just thought, Oh, it would be fun to do something in the stairwell, because I take the stairs all the time, and they’re boring,” Lauren Panzo, a Pace vice-president, said. Gallerygoers often take the stairs, too; perhaps Byrne could liven them up. Panzo proposed the stairwell idea to Byrne, who had shown a whimsical tree-diagram mural and other drawings at Pace in 2022, and spot illustrations, or dingbats, in 2020. He was intrigued.
“I thought, Oh, people are really in close proximity to the walls when they go up or down,” Byrne recalled. “What if they were confronted by all these different kinds of people and creatures, each one at eye level, so when you get to the landing you’re looking right in their eyes?” This felt fun. He made some sketches, each a “little idea”: “Let’s make it a family, a couple and children, all with building heads.” Other ideas included a winking, arms-akimbo Accusatory Guy (floor 1); “two people dancing, but they’re all free-floating ovals” (floor 6.5); a strangely glamorous blob (floor 2.5); and Spiky Person (floor 3.5). “I showed the spiky drawing to someone and they said, ‘Oh, that’s a Russian bear-hunting outfit from the nineteenth century,’ ” Byrne said. He pulled up a photograph of a nail-infused leather outfit. (The costume, whose origins are mysterious, is at the Menil Collection.) Byrne’s Spiky Person is cuddlier—part hairy Ed Koren cartoon, part “Hellraiser.” He drew nine stairwell murals in all, which are now on display indefinitely.
On the landing, Kamp projected the next sketch: two faceless eyes, for “this slightly creepy or disturbing effect,” Byrne said. Marker squeaking loudly, he drew—eyes first, dark and intense, then a series of radiating lines, which evoked sunbeams, then tears, then eyelashes. “Wow,” Byrne said.
“I thought you were going to emulate bicycle spokes,” Kamp said. Byrne laughed, sounding startled. Then he drew crisscrossing lines across the original lines, which ended up looking like the Brooklyn Bridge, or a spiderweb—or, indeed, a bicycle wheel.
Byrne, a well-known cycling enthusiast, often has insights about his art after completing it. As a kid, he drew “rocket ships and spies”; as a teen, he drew surreal cartoons inspired by Zap Comix; in Talking Heads and beyond, he drew storyboards for music videos. During the pandemic, alone at home, he began drawing dingbats. “It was fun, but it was also a kind of therapy,” he said. “In retrospect, I could look at the stuff and go, Oh, look, the drawing’s about being trapped in your body or something—some body distortion.” He went on, “I thought, O.K., you’re unconsciously working through everything that’s happening during the pandemic.” He said that drawings often help to clarify ideas. “The astronomer Vera Rubin was mystified by this data she was getting from galaxies,” he said. “As soon as she did sketches, it revealed to her what was going on. She’s been credited with verifying or discovering dark matter.” He laughed. “And the late physicist Richard Feynman did these weird diagrams with arrows and squiggles and things. He found that it was much faster to think using the diagrams than to write out the whole mathematical formula for the way the electrons or whatever were moving—subatomic stuff. Once he could think with the diagram, he could go back to the math.”
Completing the Eyes, whose radiating lines extended to the wall’s edges, required some athleticism. Byrne stood on the stool, huffing like a tennis player, then lay on the floor, pushing off the wall like a swimmer. Finished, he stood, dusted off, and regarded the image. “It’s staring at me!” he said, happily. How did it feel? “Creepy!” ♦",0.9921,positive
art,"Let’s say you’ve got a big bare wall in your home, and you want some art on it. You could hang a poster or a framed artwork, or you could learn to paint a mural yourself. Or, like [Nik Ivanov], you could build a plotter called Mural, and get it to draw something on the wall for you.
The build is straightforward enough. It uses a moving carriage suspended from toothed belts attached to two points up high on the wall. Stepper motors built into the carriage reel the belts in and out to move it up and down the wall, and from side to side. In this case, [Nik] selected a pair of NEMA 17 steppers to do the job. They’re commanded by a NodeMCU ESP32, paired with TMC2209 stepper motor drivers. The carriage also includes a pen lifter, which relies on a MG90s servo to lift the drawing implement away from the wall.
The build is quite capable, able to recreate SVG vector graphics quite accurately, without obvious skew or distortion. [Nik] has been using the plotter with washable Crayola markers, so he can print on the wall time and again without leaving permanent marks.

Historic England The paintings were created using a secco technique where pigments are applied to dry plaster
Rare 16th Century wall paintings have been revealed at a former Tudor hunting lodge. The Grotesque-style images were found behind failing plasterwork at The Ashes, in Inglewood Forest, near Ivegill, Cumbria They feature fantastical beasts and foliage arranged in decorative panels, thought to be an imitation textile design. In addition, scientific dating has confirmed that some of the earliest timbers in the building date from the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I.
Jen and Richard Arkell, the owners of The Ashes, said: ""A small fragment of wall painting - similar to that seen at nearby Dacre Hall - has been visible in the house since before we acquired the property over 20 years ago. ""However, recent work to the primary upstairs bedroom revealed much more of the composition. ""Removing old failing plaster to find these remarkable motifs and faces looking back at us is a moment we will never forget.""
Historic England The Ashes is listed as Grade II*, reflecting its exceptional historic importance
Historic England Some of the roof timbers date from the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I
Recent scientific dating using dendrochronology - a technique that analyses tree growth rings to determine age - established that the earliest part of the roof used timber, which was felled in or around the winter of 1561 to 1562. The building has been given further recognition and protection by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of Historic England. As well as the Grade II* listing for the main building, it has been awarded Grade II listing to adjoining agricultural buildings and boundary walls.
Historic England The paintings were described as a ""remarkable"" find
Myra Tolan-Smith, from Historic England, said: ""The combination of motifs discovered here is unusual even by national standards. ""Together with the newly listed farm buildings, this discovery provides remarkable insight into the evolution of a significant Tudor hunting lodge into a working farm."" Markus Campbell-Savours, MP for Penrith and Solway, said: ""It's quite clear these paintings were a remarkable find and it's wonderful news that they have now been protected as part of the building's listing.

art,"NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (AP) — The world’s woes got you down? Feeling burnout at work? Need a little something extra to fight illness or prep for surgery? The Swiss town of Neuchâtel is offering its residents a novel medical option: Expose yourself to art and get a doctor’s note to do it for free.
Under a new two-year pilot project, local and regional authorities are covering the costs of “museum prescriptions” issued by doctors who believe their patients could benefit from visits to any of the town’s four museums as part of their treatment.
The project is based on a 2019 World Health Organization report that found the arts can boost mental health, reduce the impact of trauma and lower the risk of cognitive decline, frailty and “premature mortality,” among other upsides.

Art can help relax the mind — as a sort of preventative medicine — and visits to museums require getting up and out of the house with physical activity like walking and standing for long periods.
Neuchatel council member Julie Courcier Delafontaine said the COVID crisis also played a role in the program's genesis. “With the closure of cultural sites (during coronavirus lockdowns), people realized just how much we need them to feel better.”
She said so far some 500 prescriptions have been distributed to doctors around town and the program costs “very little."" Ten thousand Swiss francs (about $11,300) have been budgeted for it.
If successful, local officials could expand the program to other artistic activities like theater or dance, Courcier Delafontaine said. The Swiss national health care system doesn’t cover “culture as a means of therapy,” but she hopes it might one day, if the results are positive enough.

Marianne de Reynier Nevsky, the cultural mediation manager in the town of 46,000 who helped devise the program, said it built on a similar idea rolled out at the Fine Arts Museum in Montreal, Canada, in 2019.
She said many types of patients could benefit.
“It could be a person with depression, a person who has trouble walking, a person with a chronic illness,” she said near a display of a feather headdress from Papua New Guinea at the Ethnographic Museum of Neuchatel, a converted former villa that overlooks Late Neuchatel.
Part of the idea is to get recalcitrant patients out of the house and walking more.

Dr. Marc-Olivier Sauvain, head of surgery at the Neuchatel Hospital Network, said he had already prescribed museum visits to two patients to help them get in better shape before a planned operation.
He said a wider rollout is planned once a control group is set up. For his practice, the focus will be on patients who admit that they’ve lost the habit of going out. He wants them to get moving.
“It’s wishful thinking to think that telling them to go walk or go for a stroll to improve their fitness level before surgery” will work, Sauvain said on a video call Saturday, wearing blue scrubs. “I think that these patients will fully benefit from museum prescriptions. We’ll give them a chance to get physical and intellectual exercise.”
“And as a doctor, it’s really nice to prescribe museum visits rather than medicines or tests that patients don’t enjoy,” he added. “To tell them ’It’s a medical order that instructs you to go visit one of our nice city museums.'”

art,"We ran a story about a wall-mounted plotter bot this week, Mural. It’s a simple, but very well implemented, take on a theme that we’ve seen over and over again in various forms. Two lines, or in this case timing belts, hang the bot on a wall, and two motors drive it around. Maybe a servo pulls the pen in and out, but that’s about it. The rest is motor driving and code.
We were thinking about the first such bot we’ve ever seen, and couldn’t come up with anything earlier than Hektor, a spray-painting version of this idea by [Juerg Lehni]. And since then, it’s reappeared in numerous variations.
Some implementations mount the motors on the wall, some on the bot. There are various geometries and refinements to try to make the system behave more like a simple Cartesian one, but in the end, you always have to deal with a little bit of geometry, or just relish the not-quite-straight lines. (We have yet to see an implementation that maps out the nonlinearities using a webcam, for instance, but that would be cool.) If you’re feeling particularly reductionist, you can even do away with the pen-lifter entirely and simply draw everything as a connected line, Etch-a-Sketch style. Maslow CNC swaps out the pen for a router, and cuts wood.
What I love about this family of wall-plotter bots is that none of them are identical, but they all clearly share the same fundamental idea. You certainly wouldn’t call any one of them a “copy” of another, but they’re all related, like riffing off of the same piece of music, or painting the same haystack in different lighting conditions: robot jazz, or a study in various mechanical implementations of the same core concept. The collection of all wall bots is more than the sum of its parts, and you can learn something from each one. Have you made yours yet?

art,"Trump bemoans a portrait of him - but gets a new one from Putin

AP A likeness of Trump hanging in the Colorado state legislature attracted his ire
US President Donald Trump has been gifted a new portrait from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin - while trashing an existing painting of him as ""truly the worst"". The new portrait has not been shown publicly. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described it as a ""personal gift"", adding that only Putin himself could disclose further details. Meanwhile, Trump took to Truth Social to criticise an earlier picture of him that hung in the Colorado State Capitol building until it was removed on Monday. The US president has paid close attention to cultivating his image, and made headlines in January by unveiling an official portrait that was variously described by critics as serious or ominous.
Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed receipt of the new work from Moscow, saying he had been asked to transport it back to Washington. He described the work as a painting - a ""beautiful portrait"" by a ""leading Russian artist"" - but gave no further critique. Trump was ""clearly touched by it"", he added. The gift was confirmed by Peskov, as American and Russian negotiators again sat down for talks in Saudi Arabia as part of Trump's drive to end the war in Ukraine. The gift highlights the diplomatic thaw between the two nations after Trump returned to the White House in January. In an interview, Witkoff - who met Putin 10 days ago - said the Russian president had been ""gracious"". Putin told him, he added, that he had prayed for Trump after an assassination attempt against him last year. That attempt on Trump's life - which took place during a rally in Pennsylvania - gave rise to perhaps the most iconic image of him ever produced. AP photographer Evan Vucci caught the moment that Trump, with a bloody ear, held up a defiant fist and told supporters to ""fight, fight, fight"". That image was further mythologised by Trump, who used it to adorn the cover of a book.

The Gallery is a room in Blue Prince with four paintings without titles. It’s a pretty rare draft — I didn’t even get it until after reaching both the Antechamber and Room 46.
Inside, you’ll have to name the four paintings to unlock the two chests. And it will get you access to the elusive Room 8.
Our Blue Prince guide will show you how to solve the Gallery painting puzzles and tell you what you get as a reward.

When you finally draft the Gallery — and it can take a while — you’ll find four paintings by the game’s dedicatee, Christopher Manson. The names of each painting are blank and there’s a set of frames next to each of them. When you use the frames to correctly name each painting, the two chests in the middle of the room will unlock.
The contents of the paintings give you the hints you need to solve them with a bit of thought. If you look around, you’ll notice that the painting titles are five, six, seven, and eight letters long. We’ll take them in that order.
Thick Gallery painting solution in Blue Prince

The first painting — the one with a five-letter title — has the word “thick” on a pond with a pair of handcuffs and a spotlight. Most of it is a distraction. What you’re really looking at is just the word, specifically the last letter.
The word “thick” is spelled with thick letters except for that last thin K. And that’s your answer: THINK.
That title is also a clue to the rest — they’re all related to (synonyms of) “think.”
Wagons Gallery painting solution in Blue Prince

The six-letter painting is of two mirrored wagons full of red things — the wagon itself, a rose, a stop sign, an apple, and a fire hydrant. On the right, a huge letter P is on the wagon.
Taking it all together, it’s a P ON RED things, but the side the P is on is mirrored. And if you mirror the RED part of that description, you get the answer: PONDER.
Eyes Gallery painting solution in Blue Prince

The seven-letter painting is mostly just eyeballs, but there are a few words as well that will help you find the answer: ACTUAL on the sign, GENU on the bottle (as in “genuine”), and a table made of the word VERI (the Latin root for “truth”).
All of those words are synonyms for REAL. Add all of those EYES to that for the answer: REALIZE.
[Author’s note: I’m just now realizing, while writing this, that the wine bottle and glass might be a play on the phrase “In vino veritas.”]
Infinity room Gallery painting solution in Blue Prince

The final puzzle’s title has eight letters. There’s an infinity symbol in a room with some boxes around it, a painting on the wall, and a rug on the floor.
For the solution, you have to take all of the parts of the painting together. In the ROOM, there’s a bunch of things that all rhyme (or contain) IN — a fIN, some pINs, a skIN on the floor, and bINs labeled with sINs. The INfINity symbol is also a sideways EIGHT.
Put it all together and you get ROOM+IN+EIGHT or RUMINATE.
Gallery rewards in Blue Prince
As you correctly enter the painting titles, the chests in the center of the room will move and open. The first two answers will get you into the first chest, and the second pair will open the second one.

The first chest is just a normal chest, so it will have coins or gems inside. The second chest, however, will include Key 8. When you use that key on a locked door that leads to rank 8, it’ll draft Room 8 (much like how the Secret Garden Key works).",0.4471,positive

25 March 2025 Share Save Thomas Mackintosh BBC News, London Share Save
Met Police The iPad Mini was found buried one inch under the sand of the River Thames and linked to a near fatal shooting five-and-a-half years earlier
A Ming vase stolen from a Swiss museum. A shooting at a comedian's house in Woodford, east London. The robbery of a luxury apartment in Sevenoaks, Kent. These seemingly unconnected events were all part of a web of international organised crime that police untangled after a six-year-long investigation. A key piece of evidence - an iPad, found under an inch of sand on the foreshore of the River Thames just downstream from the O2 Arena. Its discovery was pivotal to the investigation that has led to three people being found guilty at the Old Bailey of the near-assassination of one of Britain's most notorious armed robbers.
When found by a police officer with a metal detector on a cold November morning last year, the iPad was found caked in mud having been underwater for more than five years. Forensics were able to clean it and open the Sim tray – which still contained a pink Vodafone Sim card. Call data that was subsequently salvaged provided damning evidence on three men - Louis Ahearne, Stewart Ahearne and Daniel Kelly - who were all also involved in a heist at a museum in Switzerland a month earlier. ""I've questioned this a lot,"" Det Supt Matthew Webb ponders. ""Is it calamitous blunders tripping them up or was it just they were so blasé they wouldn't get caught?""
A 'meticulously planned' assassination plot
Video doorbell footage captured audio of several gunshots
The Ahearne brothers and Kelly first caught the attention of police after gunshots pierced the silence of a late summer evening in an affluent Woodford area on 11 July 2019. Six bullets tore through a glass conservatory at a luxury property owned by comedian Russell Kane that had been rented out to Paul Allen. One severed one of Allen's fingers, the other went through his throat and became lodged in his spinal cord, leaving him struggling to breathe and bleeding profusely. ""He's been shot, he's been shot!"" Allen's partner, Jade Bovington, screamed.

As she frantically called an ambulance, neighbours and a private security guard heard the cries and rushed to render first aid. One eyewitness described seeing an unidentified man vault a low wall, run between some bushes and get straight into a waiting vehicle which immediately sped off. To this day, Allen relies on a wheelchair, paralysed below his upper chest.

Allen gained notoriety as one of the ringleaders of what remains Britain's biggest ever armed robbery. In 2006, Allen was part of a balaclava-wearing gang toting guns including an AK-47 assault rifle who threatened to kill staff at the Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent. They stole £53m in Bank of England cash notes - leaving behind £154m which would not fit into their lorry. Allen fled to Morocco four days later, but was arrested in Rabat alongside friend and fellow robber Lee Murray, who remains in jail in nearby Tiflet. In January 2008, Allen was extradited to the UK and subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison. Allen was released in 2016 and moved back to his roots in south-east London. But he relocated to Woodford with his partner and two younger children after a gunman opened fire at him and his pregnant daughter in the doorway of their Woolwich home in September 2018. Ten months later, Allen almost died after those two bullets hit him as he stood in the kitchen of his Woodford haven.
Met Police A bullet casing was found in the back garden of the property Paul Allen was living in when he was shot
Prosecutors argued the Ahearnes and Kelly were equally culpable in the plot to murder Allen - which involved a hired car, surveillance and unregistered pay-as-you-go phones. ""This was a meticulously researched and planned assassination attempt by a team of men well versed in the level of criminality to pull it off,"" prosecutor Michael Shaw KC said. In discovering how the three knew where to find Allen, police would uncover their criminality stretched into mainland Europe.
The Geneva job and the Mayfair hotel sting
Just one month before the shooting, the Ahearne brothers and Kelly stood outside the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva equipped with a sledgehammer, angle grinders and crowbars. Within seconds of forcing their way through the front door, they shattered glass casings housing 14th Century Chinese Ming Dynasty antiques. Three items were seized - a rare pomegranate vase; a doucai-style wine cup and a porcelain bowl - and had a combined insured value of £2.8m. In their hurry to flee, Stewart scraped his stomach against the sides of the hole the gang had made in the front wooden door – leaving traces of his DNA. He also hired the getaway car, a Renault Koleos from Avis at Geneva Airport. Louis was caught on CCTV filming the inside and outside of the museum the day before the raid.
Met Police Louis Ahearne (left) and Stewart Ahearne (right) were sentenced for the museum heist last January. Although Kelly has not been charged or convicted by Swiss authorities, the Old Bailey heard it was accepted he had taken part in the raid
Within days of returning to south-east London with the stolen goods, the trio set about attempting to dispose of the items they had pinched. The brothers flew to Hong Kong with Kelly as they tried to sell one of the stolen items at an auction house. The auction house tipped off police in London, who were able to send undercover officers posing as art dealers to catch some other gang members in a sting operation as two of them tried to sell another plundered item which had been concealed in a JD Sports bag.
Met Police Stewart Ahearne was pictured by officers as he entered the five-star Marriott Hotel on Grosvenor Square during a sting operation to retrieve a stolen vase
During a seven-week trial at the Old Bailey, prosecutors argued that international burglary proved the Ahearnes and Kelly were ""at the top end"" of criminality. But little did police know while pursuing the stolen antiquities, the three would leave behind near-enough similar clues to give away their presence in the Woodford shooting.
The hire car and the Oasis purchase
In the hours after the shooting, the crime scene in Woodford was forensically examined. Six bullet casings fired from a Glock self-loading handgun were found, as were scuff marks on the property's rear garden fence from the direction the shots had been fired. DNA samples collected from the fence were found to most probably belong to Louis and Kelly. Trawling through CCTV footage, police were then able to identify the number plate of a silver-grey Renault Captur owned by hire company Avis. Records showed it had been rented by Stewart from a Dartford branch two days before the shooting, and returned the following day.
Met Police Stewart Ahearne signed for the Renault hire car in his own name and also used his credit card details
Further CCTV checks revealed that 90 minutes before the shooting the Renault had pulled into a Shell garage on Shooters Hill Road, near Greenwich Park. ""They stopped at a petrol station because Louis Ahearne was thirsty,"" Shaw told the court. ""The problem with petrol stations is they have very good CCTV,"" Shaw added.
Met Police CCTV footage from the garage showed Louis Ahearne, dressed head to toe in black, popping into the garage shop to purchase two bottles of Summer Fruits Oasis
Two days prior, Kelly and Louis had been driven by Stewart in the same Renault Captur to Ide Hill Hall, a 16th Century mansion converted into luxury apartments in Sevenoaks, Kent. Posing as police officers - with a blue flashing light on top of the Renault - the trio and another man forced their way into the gated property and stole designer items. They were later convicted at Maidstone Crown Court of burglary and the attempted burglary of another apartment.
Watch: The men tricked their way into a gated Kent development by posing as police officers and even put a siren on the top of a hired Renault Captur
The following day, 10 July, Stewart was said to have used the Renault to drive around parts of east London including Bethnal Green, Snaresbrook – and Woodford. A closer look at traffic cameras showed the Renault following a silver Mercedes that belonged to the Allens. But detectives would have to wait more than five years to learn how the men knew Allen's whereabouts.
Met Police
Uncovering the truth from the Thames
In October 2024 - four months before the Old Bailey trial started and not long after being extradited from Switzerland back to the UK - Louis issued his defence statement which contained one intriguing detail. He stated that, while heading back to Woolwich, the Renault had stopped at John Harrison Way. Louis said he hoped CCTV would be recovered from the street which would show him ""getting some air"" while Kelly disappeared in the direction of the Thames. Det Supt Webb recalls: ""We knew the vehicle had stopped in John Harrison Way and that Kelly got out of the vehicle - but no more than that. Didn't know where he went, didn't know what happened - just John Harrison Way. ""Straight away, we were thinking if somebody wants to discard something critical it's probably going to be a firearm.""
Met Police
Louis's defence statement drew attention to that stop which led to the iPad being discovered in the River Thames - which infuriated Kelly, who only found out just before the trial began. On the second day of the trial, footage from a prison van caught Kelly shouting ""how is the snitch life treating you?"" at Louis. Kelly and Stewart sat in the dock in silence throughout the trial, and declined to give evidence, having both previously expressed fears over their safety. Louis implied to jurors that it was Kelly who had pulled the trigger in the Woodford shooting. But Det Supt Webb said the iPad was the key to unravelling it all. ""Talk about people being flabbergasted and gobsmacked,"" he recalls. ""Det Insp Matthew Freeman called me and said we have gone to the Thames and found an iPad. ""I can't repeat the words I used but my jaw dropped. What a beautiful piece of the puzzle to put together.""
Call data showed both the iPad and an iPhone 6 belonging to Kelly had contacted a select few numbers, including the Ahearne brothers. The Sim card was also linked to GPS tracking devices which were found inside a car when Louis and Kelly were arrested in August 2019. Email accounts were then linked to Kelly and a close associate. From that, police were able to examine 59 Amazon and eBay purchases - some included unregistered Nokia burner phones used to communicate in the murder plot. The Sim had been in use until it vanished from the network shortly before Allen was shot.

art,"Explore Overnice's Squeezy variable font posters. Awesome graphic design merging digital flexibility with print for your next project.
Hey design friends! Let's talk type. For the longest time, fonts felt pretty fixed, right? You picked a weight, and that was that. But things are shifting, literally. Variable fonts have opened up a whole new playground for graphic design, letting type stretch, bend, and morph in ways we couldn't easily do before.
From Pixels to Paper
One studio diving headfirst into this dynamic world is Overnice. They cooked up a variable font called Squeezy, embracing all the cool possibilities – think type that adapts and animates. They even built a colorful interactive experience around it, which snagged an honor from Awwwards. Pretty cool stuff for the screen.
But the folks at Overnice thought, why should digital have all the fun? That's the question that sparked their Squeezy Variable Posters project. They decided to take the fluidity and vibrancy of their Squeezy font and translate it into tangible graphic design artifacts you can hang on your wall.
The Squeezy Poster Lowdown
So, what did they create? A series of limited-edition posters. Each design takes a letter or concept – like ""Gentle Gangster,"" ""Exotic Xenos,"" ""Vivid Vintage,"" or ""Kinetic Kraken"" – and brings it to life using the Squeezy font. The visuals play with form and overlapping colors, showcasing how the font can squeeze and expand.
The designs feel modern yet have a touch of retro charm, thanks to the color palettes and the smooth, expressive lines of the typeface. It’s a great example of how variable font technology can inspire fresh graphic design aesthetics. They didn't just type out words; they crafted visual statements where the letterforms themselves are the main event.
These aren't just quick prints, either. Overnice went for quality: museum-standard Giclee prints on hefty 300gsm matte fine art paper. Each one is a limited run of 25, making them pretty exclusive pieces. It’s a commitment to bringing that digital flexibility into a high-quality physical format. They measure 40x50 cm, ready to make a statement.
Why It Matters for Graphic Design
This project sits right at the intersection of typography, technology, and print design. It’s more than just posters; it’s a physical exploration of digital potential. Variable fonts offer incredible flexibility – adjusting weight, width, or other attributes dynamically. Seeing Overnice apply this to print reminds us that innovation isn't confined to screens.
The Squeezy posters demonstrate how graphic design can leverage new tools to create compelling visual narratives. The way the letters stretch and compress isn't just functional; it's expressive, adding personality and dynamism to the compositions. It pushes us to think about how type can perform visually, beyond just legibility.
For designers, it’s inspiring to see studios like Overnice experimenting and bridging the digital-physical gap. It challenges us to explore the capabilities of the tools we have and think about how they can translate across different mediums.
Check Them Out
These posters are a beautiful example of contemporary graphic design pushing boundaries. It’s exciting to see variable fonts moving beyond web applications and finding a place in print and physical products.

art,"While Star Wars Celebration’s main focus might be the film and TV arms of the franchise, Lucasfilm Publishing has built up its own dedicated fan base with its tie-in novels, including the High Republic initiative. After kicking off in January 2021, the era is wrapping up soon with the June release of the final book in its third phase, Charles Soule’s Trials of the Jedi.
But what lies ahead for Star Wars readers? Lucasfilm Publishing’s Star Wars Celebration panel, “Stories From a Galaxy Far, Far Away” was a good place to start for some answers. The Tokyo panel teased “the latest publishing news from the prequel trilogy to the sequel trilogy and beyond, including news on the grand finale of The High Republic,” with Adam Christopher, Tessa Gratton, Marc Guggenheim, Lydia Kang, Ethan Sacks, Phil Szostak, Alyssa Wong, and Marvel’s C.B. Cebulski on hand to make the announcements.
The biggest reveal was something on the more visual side: an Andor art book is coming!
Here’s the description from the official press release: “The Art of Star Wars: Andor (The Complete Series) takes fans behind the scenes of the critically acclaimed Disney+ Star Wars series set in the early days of the Rebellion and following Rogue One‘s Cassian Andor as he grows from thief to rebel spy.”
“Interviews conducted by The Art of Star Wars: The Mandalorian author and Lucasfilm creative art manager Phil Szostak with Academy Award-nominated showrunner/head writer Tony Gilroy, Lucasfilm art department ‘visualists,’ and key crew and creatives will give an in depth look at every facet of the creative process that brought this unique Star Wars story to the screen. With hundreds of stunning ship and vehicle designs, character studies, weapons, gadgets, storyboards, and so much more, this book is the ultimate visual companion to Andor.”
The bad news is that The Art of Star Wars: Andor will set you back $50, and won’t be out until March 2026.
The panel today also included more discussion of the final High Republic book, Trials of the Jedi, mentioned above. Other new titles announced: comics Star Wars: The High Republic – The Battle of Eriadu and Star Wars: The High Republic – The Beacon; the Jecki and Yord-focused Padawan adventure The Acolyte: The Crystal Crown; another art book, Industrial Light & Magic: 50 Years of Innovation; and comics Star Wars: Hyperspace Stories – Codebreaker, for Poe Dameron fans; and new issues of Star Wars: Legacy of Vader; and Star Wars: Jedi Knights.
Last week, ahead of the panel itself, Lucasfilm Publishing dropped some early news about upcoming releases—including Adam Christopher’s Star Wars: Master of Evil Darth Vader novel; lavish two-volume art book Doug Chiang: The Cinematic Legacy and the Star Wars Legacy; Halloween-themed Star Wars: I Find Your Lack of Candy Disturbing, featuring art by Jeffrey Brown; and Disney+ behind-the-scenes deep dives The Art of Star Wars: The Acolyte and The Acolyte Visual Guide. Other previously announced releases include an updated new edition of Star Wars: The Blueprints, as well as an updated new edition of Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy.
But that’s not all! At another Lucasfilm Publishing panel earlier in the day, “Manga Mania!”, the company also shared what’s coming from that arm of the company.

art,"In the spring of 1942, the thirty-four-year-old artist and designer Tirzah Garwood resolved to start her memoirs. An accomplished wood engraver, illustrator, and maker of patterned papers, she had already produced an impressive body of creative work, but this was the first time she’d attempted a book. “I want to write my life while I am still happy,” she admits toward the end of the manuscript that was eventually published, many decades later, as Long Live Great Bardfield, & Love to You All: The Autobiography of Tirzah Garwood. Living in Essex with her husband, the artist Eric Ravilious, and their three young children, Garwood was recovering from an emergency mastectomy following a breast cancer diagnosis. Her convalescence had given her the chance to start writing in earnest, which, she explains, “otherwise I should never have had time to do.”
How to find the time had long been a pressing question for Garwood, as it has been for so many mothers who are also artists. “I always regret that I stopped working because it is difficult with a house to think about,” she wrote to a newly married friend in 1936, encouraging her not to abandon her own painting. Yet in “Tirzah Garwood: Beyond Ravilious,” an immaculate show at London’s Dulwich Picture Gallery, Garwood emerges as an artist who who adapted her practice to her life, painting and modeling her home, her children, scenes from local village life, and the buildings and people that were the backdrop of her daily routines. Even before she was a wife and mother she was drawn to depicting household scenes. Her wood engraving Spring (1927) shows two women cleaning a bedroom, one down on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floor, the other plumping a pillow; the illustration Commercial Traveller (circa 1927) has a salesman exhibiting his wares on the doorstep to an audience of women and children.
Private Collection Tirzah Garwood: The Wife, 1929
But as the show’s curator, James Russell, emphasizes in its comprehensive and elegant catalogue, the “main aim” of the exhibition is to recognize Garwood as more than simply “Mrs. Eric Ravilious.” That was how The Times identified her in their review of the Arts Council Gallery’s June 1952 memorial exhibition of her work, a year after her death from cancer at forty-two. Originally held in the spring at the Towner Art Gallery in Eastbourne, the memorial show generated enough popular demand that it reopened later in the summer in London, but thereafter Garwood’s work was largely forgotten. Her memoir, which she left unfinished at her death, remained unpublished until 2012, when Fleece Press issued an edition edited and with notes by her daughter Anne Ullmann (reprinted in 2016 as Long Live Great Bardfield: The Autobiography of Tirzah Garwood by Persephone Books). Little of her work made it into other shows. Not only is “Tirzah Garwood: Beyond Ravilious” the first major exhibition of her work, many of the eighty-odd pieces on display have never before been shown to the public and are loaned from private collections.
Anyone who thinks they’re familiar with Garwood’s art will surely find the exhibition a revelation. For every piece that’s recognizable—some of her more oft-reproduced wood engravings, for example, or the marbled papers that she made during her marriage to Ravilious, which the Times praised as “among the most delicate and the prettiest that have ever been produced”—four or five are utterly new. Most striking is the breadth and diversity of the work on display: not just those engravings and papers but embroidery, watercolors, oil paintings, two-dimensional paper collages of what amounts to an entire village of houses and buildings in box frames, a patchwork quilt, pencil and ink-wash drawings.
And yet it all coheres as the oeuvre of a single artist. Garwood paid consistently close attention to detail—whether in the precise draughtsmanship of Six Eggs (circa 1945), a color pencil illustration for a children’s book, or in the Wes Anderson–like symmetry of her boxed houses. One can also trace an increasingly prominent note of whimsy. The elegant meticulousness of her early wood engravings—the medium in which she first proved her talents but which she put aside to devote more of her attention to marriage and motherhood—gives way to landscapes and gatherings stranger and more mysterious.
*
Garwood was born in 1908, the third of five children of a blonde beauty from Croydon and a royal engineer with what his daughter described as “a romantic nature.” She was christened Eileen Lucy, but when her grandmother sent a letter shortly after her birth inquiring after “Little Tirtia,” she quickly acquired the nickname “Tirzah.” The family moved often due to Colonel Garwood’s military career, but when Tirzah was sixteen they settled permanently in Eastbourne, a Victorian resort town on England’s southeast coast, where she attended the local art school.

There she met Ravilious, a recent graduate of the design school at London’s prestigious Royal College of Art, now teaching in Eastbourne. Five years Garwood’s senior, Ravilious was among a group of young artists identified by their tutor Paul Nash as an “outbreak of talent.” Nash had taught his protégé wood engraving, a medium Ravilious quickly excelled in, and now Garwood too proved a natural: just a year after she made her first piece, her quartet The Four Seasons (1927) was accepted for the annual exhibition of the Society of Wood Engravers (to which Ravilious had been elected in 1920). The recognition helped her convince her parents that she should move to London to study at the Central School of Arts and Crafts.
Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Table-Turning, 1928
Garwood arrived in the city in 1928, installing herself in a room in the attic of the Ladies’ National Club in Kensington. Her recollections of boarding house life in Long Live Great Bardfield have the flavor of a Muriel Spark novel. The building is inhabited by spinsters, retired nurses, and women of modest but independent means. “One middle-aged woman had apparently no occupation,” she writes. “She just lived and read novels from the library in an unending stream.” Garwood, by contrast, had come to London with the hope of being able to earn her own living. She recalls dancing “round and round the room with joy” on the “wonderful, wonderful evening” that she was given her first job, with the BBC: in 1929 she designed the crest for the Radio Times, the UK’s weekly television listings guide, for which she went on to produce regular work on commission.
Garwood and Ravilious married in 1930. Initially wedded life made little difference to her work. She had, she admitted in her memoirs, not “learned anything that was at all useful in a house” in the course of her education, and when they were newlyweds Eric was the more accomplished cook. Garwood did design work for the Curwen, Golden Cockerel, and Kynoch presses and assisted her husband with some of his projects, from doing the fiddly work of cutting away the white backgrounds of the wood engravings he was making for an edition of Twelfth Night to helping him paint murals at the Midland Hotel, Morecambe, in 1933—not that such endeavors were publicly credited to her at the time.
In 1931 the couple moved to the village of Great Bardfield, in Essex, to share a house with Ravilious’s college friend Edward Bawden and his wife, Charlotte. What the four of them established later grew into a larger, loosely connected community known today as the Great Bardfield Artists. In his group biography, Ravilious & Co. (2017), Andy Friend explains that living and working side-by-side yielded an especially “rich artistic haul” for the two men. Their relationship was equal parts encouragement and healthy competition. They tried to outdo one another by rising earlier in the day, or painting outdoor scenes in the rain, cold, or blistering heat.
Private collection A sheet of marbled paper by Tirzah Garwood, 1934–1941
In the background of this rambunctious working partnership was a less frequently cited collaboration between Garwood and Charlotte, who began experimenting together with paper marbling in the winter of 1934. Less often noted, too, is the mutual influence between Garwood’s output in that medium—the elaborate designs and tints she managed to achieve—and the pattern-making in her husband’s landscapes from these years, or the color layering in his lithography. One of Russell’s ingenious decisions is to position such pieces—the show includes eleven of Ravilious’s works—side by side. The free-flowing forms in Garwood’s marbled papers and her use of organic, natural ink tones (sepia, rust-red, black, blue and gray, the softest pink) echo the shapes and colors of her husband’s The Potato Field (1941) and Vicarage in Winter (1935). Look closely at the latter next to Garwood’s papers and the crosshatching of pastel tones in the sky becomes more obvious as a kind of pattern work.
During their years in Essex both Garwood and Ravilious had romantic and sexual entanglements with other people. He was the instigator, and his first infidelities caused Garwood much pain, but she took solace in her liaison with John Aldridge, a friend of both hers and Ravilious’s and one of the leading artists in their Great Bardfield set. “We made love so perfectly together that it was impossible to think of it as wrong or harmful to anyone else. But we both knew it couldn’t go on indefinitely,” she writes in her memoirs. And it didn’t—Aldridge was also married and had no intention of leaving his wife. Garwood’s and Ravilious’s relationship seems to have survived because neither believed they belonged exclusively to the other. “My loving them,” Garwood writes of the men in her life, “was the important thing and not my possessing them.” In large part this attitude was possible because she and Ravilious so seriously acknowledged the weight of their art.

The gallery’s shape—a pair of compact yet high-ceilinged square rooms and a pair of longer, leaner galleries that run between them—favors exhibitions with a linear narrative, which suits “Beyond Ravilious” well. The first room introduces us to Garwood’s early work. Her wood engravings dominate—some already familiar, others entirely new. Table Turning (1928) uses the medium’s stark black-and-white contrasts to evocative effect: the extraordinary detail of the fabrics worn by the séance’s participants—beading, fringing, gleaming silk and taffeta—momentarily distracts you before you find yourself drawn into the deep dark hole of the table at the center of the image. Hanging by the side of Yawning, a 1928 wood engraving of a woman in a state of morning deshabille, is a colorful, similarly intricate embroidery of the same title from the 1930s. Not only are Garwood’s stitches faultless, down to each individual hairpin discarded on the woman’s dressing table, she also achieves depth and texture by using different fabrics alongside the needlework. From beneath the woman’s robe peeks the lacy hem of her nightgown, and the tousled end of her braided hair is a fluffed-up skein of wool. The fringing of the runner on the dressing table is a fine cream appliqué.

The central galleries showcase Garwood’s talent for working in a range of media: another gorgeous needlework embroidery, of a woman watering her vegetable garden; a quilt; marbled papers; collages; miniature boxed and wall-mounted doll-house-like constructions of village buildings, complete with moving parts. Here too the detail is in the layering of materials. Snipped lace curtains. A leaf print repurposed as a climbing plant, winding its way up a paper trellis. Stonework and miniature cottage loaves on display in the window of a bakery fashioned out of Sankey’s Pyruma (a cement-like substance originally intended to repair fireplaces, but often used by model-makers). Strips of dark forest-green corduroy as a thick hedge—left over, we imagine, from a homemade pair of children’s dungarees; Garwood was a skilled dressmaker who regularly made clothes for both herself and her children.
Garwood’s first child with Ravilious, John, was born in 1935. The demands on her time affected her work, even as motherhood also clearly inspired her. Four years later, in August 1939, she gave birth to a second son, James. War was declared with Germany the following month, and Ravilious was commissioned as an Official War Artist. Their final child, Anne, arrived in 1941, a year before Garwood suffered a series of tragedies.
First came her cancer diagnosis and treatment, followed shortly thereafter by a therapeutic abortion. (Her doctors considered this unplanned pregnancy inadvisable because it had only been three months since her mastectomy.) In her memoirs she remembers that she was discharged from the hospital still bleeding and too uncomfortable for her and Ravilious to make love, much to their mutual frustration. A week later Ravilious left for the front in Iceland, where, that September, he was killed in action when his plane disappeared over the Atlantic. Neither it nor any survivors were ever found. He was thirty-nine years old.
Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Springtime of Flight, 1950
When he chose to leave, it hadn’t just been out of patriotic duty: he had long wished to paint Iceland’s extraordinary light. “I wondered why I had urged him to go,” Garwood remembers of the morning he left, “and realised that it was because I accepted the fact that his work was more important to him than me and I appreciated this attitude.”
*
Garwood mourned her husband’s loss deeply, but it did not destroy her. The exhibition gives a potent sense of something shifting in her artistic practice in the years after Ravilious’s death: a release of light and color in the midst of war, widowhood, and illness, but also a return to the playfulness of her past and the visual landscape of her childhood. Her work from this period draws on elements of traditional Victoriana, as in the large and opulent scrapbook she kept throughout her life: tin soldiers, découpage, cigarette cards, dolls’ houses.
Toward the end of her life Garwood turned to oils. In the nine years she had left, she married again—to Henry Swanzy, a pioneering BBC producer whose radio program Caribbean Voices introduced writers such as V.S. Naipul and Derek Walcott to the British public—raised her children, and kept working. Anne’s memories of coming home from school during these years are rich with “the smell of oil paint and turpentine,” her mother “reluctantly” finishing work and cleaning her brushes.
In 1948 Garwood’s cancer returned, now advanced and incurable. From the hospital bed in London where she was receiving palliative treatment, she wrote to a friend that she’d been “luckier than most people apart from wishing that I could have had more time for getting on with painting.” Oil on canvas had by then become the sole focus of her creative efforts, perhaps due to necessity—she was confined to her bed and no longer capable of the labor that much of her prior work required.
Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Erskine Returning at Dawn, 1950
The show’s final room is devoted to the oils she executed during her last twelve months, all shot through with a sense of the magical and surreal. The obvious visual comparison is the work of Leonora Carrington, but I’m more inclined to think of the aesthetics of Barbara Comyns. Her own paintings aren’t a patch on Garwood’s, but her charming and strange midcentury novels—which are possessed of a unique kitchen-sink-style magical realism—have long struck me as sharing DNA with Long Live Great Bardfield. Like Comyns, Garwood reports the story of her life crisply and matter-of-factly, conjuring up the essences of the people around her and the intensity of her experiences in swift, simple images, but always with a keen eye for eccentrics and capriciousness. When she and Ravilious first lived together, she writes in one memorable passage, they had a maid who, when she worked at a hotel, had once “accidentally shut a cat in the oven but she smelled his singeing fur in the nick of time.” It’s like something out of Comyns’s novel The Vet’s Daughter (1959). Both women’s storytelling, whether visual or verbal, marries practicality and whimsy, the sinister and the comic. They each retain a strong sense of innocence, often in the face of significant suffering.
Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Snowmen at Hedingham, 1950
Garwood’s visual otherworldliness isn’t quite the dreamlike fantasy of Carrington’s visions, but rather the stuff of fairy tales and childlike sensitivities: a homecoming to the world of “fairies and flowers” she spent hours painting as a child. Dolls and other toys—train sets and building blocks—feature heavily. So do animals beloved by infants—cats, ducks and geese, even a tortoise. In Snowmen at Hedingham (1950), a smiling family of snow-people stand in front of a warmly glowing red-brick garden wall: mother, father, and child. It makes for a striking contrast with her earlier Snow Woman (1938), an ink and wash creation of notably duller monochrome tones, the air thick and gray.
While she was painting these final works, Garwood knew she was dying. It’s impossible to see Hide and Seek (1950) without feeling the weight of her mortality. It looks down on the garden of her and Swanzy’s house in London’s Primrose Hill, her children rendered as flashes of color among the high green grass, dense shrubbery, and trees, already at a distance from their mother alone in her sickbed upstairs. She was also often in a lot of pain. Nevertheless her friend Olive Cook related that she she declared this period “the happiest year of her life,” amazing everyone with what Cook described to Anne as “determination, courage and unquenchable gaiety,” letting her work absorb her completely.
Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Hide and Seek, 1950
Even as her daily life contracted, as the exhibition’s final room testifies, her imaginative world was expanding. As Jennifer Higgie notes in her excellent catalogue essay, Garwood always admired what she described as “the charming distortions of perspectives and proportion, the fantasy and the unexpected beauties of colour that young children produce in their pictures.” Erskine Returning at Dawn (1950) shows the family cat marching home from a night on the prowl, huge and magisterial, taking up the entire foreground of the canvas, throwing off the perspective of the trees on the horizon in the background. In Charlotte’s Doll (1950) the subject of the piece has been posed among a backdrop of tulips that tower above her—a little Victorian explorer deep in an uncharted, exotic jungle. By comparison, in Doll’s House Room (1950) it’s Garwood and Swanzy who’ve been transformed into tiny toy figurines.
Swanzy features more often on the exhibition’s walls than Ravilious, who appears only in The Vegetable Garden (1929), surveying his crops, hefty marrows tucked under his arms. (Garwood, by comparison, appears regularly in his work.) Perhaps Swanzy’s presence in these scenes simply speaks to his presence in Garwood’s now reduced domestic world, but it also suggests a lack of competition in her second marriage. Husband and wife each had their separate spheres of work, as Garwood acknowledged in her official-looking Portrait of Henry Swanzy (1947), in which he’s sat on a red sofa, dressed smartly in a suit and tie, a copy of the periodical African Affairs beside his right elbow, above which, in the background of the image, a globe sits atop a bookcase and three carved wooden African figurines stand on the mantlepiece.
Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Spanish Lady, 1950
To see this impressive intellectual shrunk into a toy-sized figure in Doll’s House Room makes for a striking contrast. On first glance it looks like an innocent, benign scene suitable for a nursery wall, but on closer inspection, there’s something decidedly uncanny about this image of humans rendered helplessly inanimate. I’m reminded of Garwood’s eerie early wood engraving, Cat into Wife (circa 1928), in which an otherwise ordinary, cosy, hearthside domestic scene is transmuted into one of terror, the monstrous half-feline/half-human figure sprawled on the floor, the shocked husband watching on in horror. Other colorful, cheerful surfaces in these late works also belie a sense of menace: Weewak’s Kitten (1950), with its ominous black pansies and creepy black cat lurking in the grass, or Suffragette’s House (1951), in which dancing matchstick dolls circle the building like pagans performing their rites in a folk-horror film.
On first glance, Spanish Lady (1950), the final painting on display, suggests a more serene, sublime metamorphosis. A Victorian clay water bottle in the shape of a crinolined lady with a long, elegant neck, not unlike Garwood’s, stands next to a bed of spring flowers, glowing in a softly moonlit garden. It’s widely acknowledged as a kind of self-portrait in disguise. Garwood has transformed herself into an angelic, eternal statue. Yet the image is strangely haunting, not entirely tranquil. One is reminded that a life was cut short—that an artist was silenced in her prime.",0.9997,positive
art,"The Maverick’s Museum, by Blake Gopnik (Ecco). Albert C. Barnes was born into poverty in 1872, in Philadelphia, and went on to make a fortune as the inventor of a topical antiseptic and to amass a staggering collection of modern art. Gopnik’s animated biography chronicles Barnes’s lifelong campaign to make art accessible to the working class, a democratizing impulse that found its greatest expression in the Barnes Foundation, which opened in 1925 to display his acquisitions. But the collector was also known for his irascibility, and Gopnik touches on the contradictions between his high-mindedness—Barnes was a stalwart defender of Black rights and culture—and his temper. Ultimately, Gopnik figures that “Barnes’s public cruelties might be just about balanced by private kindnesses.”
The Franklin Stove, by Joyce E. Chaplin (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). In the mid-eighteenth century, during a period of cooling known as the Little Ice Age, Benjamin Franklin began designing a heating device that would be more efficient than the traditional fireplace. Chaplin’s richly textured history documents the brilliant theories and innovations that led to the Franklin stove’s creation, but it also charts the human and environmental costs: produced in part by slave labor on tribal lands, the stove eventually burned coal. This story holds numerous lessons for our era; among them, Chaplin writes, is that any “techno-optimistic” solution to the climate crisis, though it might work in the short term, may have unintended, and potentially harmful, consequences.

art,"Two well-known creators in the miniatures gaming space are suddenly getting way into nail art — you know, the other painting hobby enjoyed by millions of people around the world. Brent Amberger of Goobertown Hobbies fame and Casey, the creator of eBay Miniatures Rescue, showed up at this year’s AdeptiCon convention with a clever new way to paint your miniatures — and it could make one of the hobby’s most hated features a thing of the past.
The hated feature in question is the humble waterslide decal, which hobbyists across dozens of different franchises have come to loathe over the years. Done well, using something like Microscale Industries’ Micro Sol and Micro Set, decals can look great. But it can be incredibly challenging to get a decal to lay flat on a curved surface — you know, stuff like shields and the shoulder pauldrons on Space Marines. Even if you’ve mastered the process, which is ably described in the Winterdyne Commission Modeling Blog guide to Waterslide Decals (included as part of our larger miniatures painting guide), it can still go pear-shaped on you if your surface isn’t properly prepared. The result? A ghostly white outline surrounding the art on the decal itself.
Brent and Casey, partners in the newly formed Goblin Hobbies, recently discovered nail art stamping plates. These chemically etched metal plates can be made to feature any kind of two-dimensional art that you like. Drop a little paint on the plate, wipe it smooth, and you can pick the image up off the plate with a silicone pad. Just gently press the pad onto your miniature, and Bob’s your uncle. Their silicone pads are even transparent, so you can see your model through the handle to line things up perfectly.

The technology to do this kind of thing with ink and paint has been around for centuries. I’m sure my grandfather had something similar for his basement printing business in the 1940s. But its application to nail art is relatively new. Goblin Hobbies hopes to bring it even further, into the mainstream of hobby miniatures gaming.

art,"All weekend at Star Wars Celebration Japan, the connection between the galaxy far, far away and its inspirational roots in Japanese media has been everywhere. But perhaps one of the most joyful celebrations of that connection was tucked away among the hustle and bustle of the show floor.
At the back side of a special anime and manga pavilion on the Celebration show floor, primarily dedicated to displays of concept art and props from the first two volumes of Star Wars Visions, a whole wall of art invited congoers to see a special mashup gallery merging the worlds of Studio Ghibli and Star Wars.
Featuring art from a bevy of talent from across Lucasfilm divisions—spearheaded by, of course, none other than noted Ghibli fan Dave Filoni himself—the gallery saw characters and ideas from across Star Wars merge with iconic Ghibli films and imagery, from Porco Rosso to Princess Mononoke, and even touching on Lucasfilm’s actual official collaboration with the studio, Zen: Grogu and Dust Bunnies.
“Japan has always influenced my creativity. I grew up loving Tokusatsu, and was captivated by anime series like Macross,” Filoni wrote in a message accompanying his own art piece in the collection, “Ahsokanoke”, depicting Ahsoka and Grogu in a Ghibli-esque style.
“After I saw Miyazaki’s film Princess Mononoke, it changed the way I thought about animation. I loved everything about that film and it made a lasting impression on me. When I went to create Ahsoka Tano, I knew I wanted to imbue her with a bit of San. So this is why Ahsoka has two ‘wolf fangs’ on her cheeks, in homage to Miyazaki’s film.”

You’ll come across a pair of pictures (or paintings, or drawings, or whatever you want to call them) in every Blue Prince room. This pair of pictures (or paintings or drawings) serves as the basis for one of the most baffling puzzles in the game.
Our Blue Prince guide will tell why there are two pictures in every room and tell you everything you need to know about how to solve the picture puzzle, including examples, the solution, the reward.
Why are there two pictures in each room in Blue Prince?
Before we outright spell out the solution to Blue Prince’s wild picture puzzle, we’ll point you in the direction of where you can find some hints. There are a few rooms you can draft that will give you some clues:
Commissary
Study
Classroom 5
PILOT without PLOT is I. Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon
In the Commissary, check the bulletin board. You’ll see one picture labeled WITH and one labeled WITHOUT. This is the biggest clue about the process of solving this puzzle. It implies you need to, for lack of a better word, “subtract” one picture from the other.
Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon
In the Study, things are clarified even further. You’ll find a note asking for artwork and another with some unused examples. On the chalkboard, you’ll find a big hint about how to put it all together: a grid system that maps directly to a blank Mt. Holly blueprint, with the letter F in the spot the Entrance Hall always goes. Some small chicken scratch reads, “Face & Ace.”

If you manage to draft Classroom 5, you’ll find examples of pictures on the boards around the room. But the only two hints you really need are those from the Commissary’s bulletin board and the Study’s chalkboard.
[Ed. note: Spoilers follow for the Blue Prince picture puzzle below.]
How to solve picture puzzles in Blue Prince
In most rooms, you’ll find two pictures. Generally speaking, these will be arranged with one on the left and one on the right. Your job is to find two words — one for the drawing on the left and one for the right — that differ by only one letter, and then remove the shared letters.
Let’s go through an example.
FACE without ACE is F. Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon
In the Entrance Hall, you’ll see a pair of pictures framing the door on the right. Both are of hands holding playing cards. On the left is a queen, and there’s an ace on the right. But a queen is also a FACE card. So, FACE without ACE is just F.
Let’s do some more.
COAST without COST is A. Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon
Some pictures are used multiple times, though, and have different meanings.
The TAG — the price tag with a ten on it — can mean TAG , TEN , or COST .
The drawing of a PLANE can mean PLANE or FLIER .
The drawing of a hand painting a moon(?) can mean PLANET or CREATE (because the hand is creating a drawing).
The drawing of a tree can be a PINE or a FIR .
The chart can mean CHART or RATE (because the arrow shows the rate of increase on the chart).
Other drawings only ever mean one thing, like the PRY bar, the TIGER or the TIERed serving dish.
DESSERT without DESERT is S. Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon
Your task in each room is to look at the two pictures, and subtract the second from the first. The pictures change each day (more on this in a second), so if you get stuck, you can always try again another day.
For what it’s worth, not every room has pictures. According to our testing, green rooms like the Veranda or the Patio appear to never have pictures. Some hallways don’t have them. The Foundation doesn’t either. This is only a problem for one day at a time, though, as you’ll solve the pictures puzzle across multiple days.
Full Study chalkboard pictures puzzle solution in Blue Prince
Refer back to the grid that was on the chalkboard in the study. (You’re going to want a journal for this.) As you figure out which letters go in which boxes, you’ll slowly fill out a complete phrase.
The house in Blue Prince is arranged in a five-by-eight grid. Each day, the rooms will move around based on how you draft them, and when they do, the pictures will change. That’s because the letters are always in the same position. (This is also why the pictures in the Entrance Hall never change.) That means, no matter what room you put there, the bottom left corner will always be S.
With a bit of work and some patience, you can fill in a grid with each letter you find there. When you’re done, you’ll be able to read the message.

The message is: IF WE COUNT SMALL GATES EIGHT DATES CRACK EIGHT SAFES.
So now what?
Picture puzzle reward in Blue Prince
Basically, this phrase is a hint that anything with code or combination on it is looking for a date. This includes the Orchard gate — “if we count small gates.” The safes it mentions can be found in rooms like the Shelter (the time lock safe counts as a date), Office, Study, Boudoir, and more.
These safes reveal red letters, which in turn fill out the backstory for Blue Prince. Want to track them all down? See our guide on all safe codes.

art,"Many people are multidisciplinary, but few are as niche a concoction as London-based creative Annie Hall. “I’ve been calling myself a jumper maker and illustrator,” Annie says, “which I think sums it up fairly well.” Combining illustration and knitting, Annie’s practice is profoundly analogue, and her style is equally as distinctive. She creates warm, odd and charming characters and tableaus in sustainable Yorkshire spun and dyed wool. Having originally studied illustration, Annie got her hands on a knitting machine to keep her fingers busy. “I’ve always liked ‘applied illustration’ in that I’ve always enjoyed putting drawings onto physical objects rather than on paper,” she explains. She’s also dabbled in screen printing, papier-mache, clay and painting furniture. “I think knitting is just another way to physically make something out of your drawings,” Annie says, “a tactile, cosy and useful form for my drawings to take.”
The drawings themselves – featuring friendly (sometimes uncanny) characters, like conniving devils and endearing animal faces – are both familiar and unusual, finding a tender middle ground between likeable and off-kilter. Albeit, with eyes that seem to follow you around the room. This is due to Annie’s childhood obsession with illustrative characters, the likes of Richard Scarry’s creations, alongside her more contemporary interests, including kids’ clothing patterns and knitting books. “I had some great books growing up, and as a child I thought ‘children’s book illustrator’ was one of the main jobs that adults had,” Annie says. “As I grew up and realised this wasn’t the case, I was still drawn to illustration though, purely because it looked fun.” This laid-back yet earnest approach is evident in the mischievous characters, scenes and landscapes she shapes. “Whenever I’m drawing, I want the characters to look cheeky or fun,” Annie ends. “I don’t take the drawing part too seriously and quite like leaning into bad or messy drawings.”",0.9924,positive

art,"The artist Ser Serpas was riding shotgun in a rented U-Haul truck through Williamsburg the other day, lamenting the state of New York junk. “Our stuff is just flimsier,” she said. “I can spot IKEA from a mile away.” Just then, her driver, the art handler Neo Gibson, clocked a steel object nestled in a heap of deli trash: a circular, city-issued bike rack, freshly ripped from the sidewalk. The pair put on work gloves, then slotted the rack into their truck between a rusted table frame, a purple vacuum, and the base of a futon. “Those exposed bolts!” Serpas said admiringly.
Serpas has transformed her haul into a series of junk-pile sculptures for “The Gatherers,” a group exhibition at MoMA PS1 opening later this month which focusses on contemporary waste. She will then fly to Switzerland to begin curbside scavenging for a show at Kunsthalle Basel. But new Swiss restrictions on bulk garbage disposal are creating panic among the curators. “They’re worried there won’t be enough trash for me to fill five rooms,” Serpas, who is twenty-nine and lives on the Lower East Side, said. She wore blue coveralls and old white Converses, her standard picking uniform.
As the U-Haul zigzagged beneath the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, Serpas ignored a hot-water heater (“too heavy”) and a mattress propped against a utility pole. “I’m not a mattress person anymore,” she said. An abandoned orange shopping cart was added to the pile, then quickly filled with silver snack-bag material pulled from a dumpster belonging to NAP Industries, “a leader in flexible packaging manufacturing since 1963,” according to a sign. Serpas beamed: “It’s so light and radiant. I can make a disco ball with this.”
In sanitation circles, amateur trash pickers are known as “garbage groupies.” The art world prefers “assemblagists.” Either way, Serpas is a rising star of the movement, earning accolades for recent biennials at the Whitney and the Hammer, in L.A. She favors worn-out home furnishings and industrial components for her combines, which she stacks precariously on-site and sometimes sets ablaze. “Tbilisi has the best trash because everything is passed down for so long,” she said. “Paris is also good. In New York, you need to know where to look.” The previous day’s trip to Red Hook had yielded the remains of an elevator shaft, a car windshield, a stack of mops, and a frayed trampoline. “We have a lot of flat things,” Serpas said. “Now I need orifices.”
On Wythe Avenue, the truck lurched to a stop behind a pair of professional junk luggers, who were hauling away the contents of a gutted luxury apartment. “They’re taking all our shit!” Serpas said, striding toward the competition. One of the luggers offered her the pick of the litter but warned against some old chairs.
“Those are rotting,” he said.
“Like, bug-rotting?” Serpas asked. She plucked an umbrella stand and some lawn chairs from the pile instead.
Serpas got into assemblage eight years ago, after earning a fine-arts degree from Columbia. Struggling to produce mixed-media sculptures for a solo show at a gallery in Miami, she stumbled across the remains of a foreclosed house in South Beach. “It was a eureka moment,” she recalled. She stayed up all night assembling the detritus into gridded displays: an overturned armchair doused in gasoline, a glass tabletop balanced on a bookshelf wrapped in electrical wiring. The show was a success—the Rubell Museum acquired pieces—and also a lesson. “The bookcase had termites,” Serpas said. “They needed to get the gallery fumigated.” Otherwise, she said, “I’ve never caused an active infestation in any of the ten or fifteen galleries I’ve shown in. Knock on wood.”
Some institutions have their own sanitary precautions. Before her show at PS1, a vender from Ozone Park will treat the found objects with a substance known as Vikane. The Whitney has a fumigation guy who uses a process called ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. Last year, the museum rejected two pieces of metal sheathing that Serpas had intended to use in its biennial alongside a note: “Bird poop Serpas.”
Back at her studio, in Williamsburg, Serpas assessed the day’s collection. “They all have a good palette,” she said. “I can start to see it coming together.” She paused to rest in the studio’s “lounge”: a few tattered chairs and a coffee table—leftovers from past sculptures, already fumigated. ♦",-0.7667,negative
art,"Even if you know nothing about the Swedish doctor, professor, and naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778), you probably know about his greatest innovation: binomial nomenclature. Prior to Linnaeus, naturalists had no systematic way to name a plant or animal. Linnaeus came up with the idea of naming according to genus and species; hence, humans are known as homo sapiens. Genus is the larger umbrella term of related groups (wolves and dogs are part of the same genus, Canis). Linnaeus’s system allowed naturalists to easily group and categorize the natural world, making it more legible for scientific inquiry.
Linnaeus was also the first to grow a banana in Europe. He was able to do this because he was obsessed with collecting as many samples of the natural world as possible. He was also one of the first people to use what we think of as note cards.
Linnaeus’s life’s work was one of organization and categorization. So, it makes sense that he was also fascinated by note-taking. In fact, he innovated quite a few systems, which we’ll cover in this post.
Linnaeus’s Herbarium
As a student at the University of Lund, Linnaeus began collecting dried plant and lichen specimens. By the time of his death, he amassed over 13,000 specimens. This collection made it possible for him to set out to give species binomial names in Species Plantarum (1753).
Linnaeus’s major innovation here was to release his specimens from the tyranny of a bound book—as most herbariums were kept (see, for example, Emily Dickinson’s herbarium). Instead, he pasted specimens on loose paper that he organized in a custom made filing cabinet. The point was to group similar specimens together (plants with two stamens vs. plants with three stamens). This made his collection flexible and infinitely expandable. As he discovered new examples of specific genuses, he could group them together without disassembling the entire collection.
The Linnaean Society put together this wonderful video to demonstrate how Linnaeus used his herbarium cabinet:
Originally, Linnaeus collected specimens himself, but as his fame grew, acquaintances would send him specimens. He also sent his students off on expeditions to collect samples.
Linnaeus’s Sketches
From 1732-1735, Linnaeus traveled through the northern parts of Sweden. He aimed to collect information on his country’s natural resources. He had long conversations with the native people of Lapland, the Sámi. He copied the information he learned in his “Lapland Journals” along with intricate drawings.
For Linnaeus, the actual specimen would always trump a drawing of it. So he also carried back many samples of the natural vegetation he encountered in Lapland. In Genera Plantarum, he went so far as to exclaim,
I do not recommend drawings . . . for determining genera – in fact, I absolutely reject them…
Even so, drawing was often necessary to document his findings. In his “Botanical Notebook” he illustrates different types of leaves and flower that would help him identify plants.
Soon Linnaeus was publishing his findings and updating them every year with new editions of his books. To prepare for new editions, he usually wrote in copies of the books themselves.
Linnaeus’s Interleaved Books
In the seventeenth-century, writing in books was a common practice. So common, in fact, that books were sold “interleaved,” meaning that they had blank pages inserted. This is how Linnaeus continued to build on his botanical research. As he learned more about the flora he documented, he added notations that he could use in subsequent editions of this work.

This practice was so common that readers of Linnaeus’s work bought interleaved copies of their own so they could record their personal observations of the natural world alongside the great naturalist’s. This, for example, is how the 18th-century poet Thomas Gray read Linnaeus’s work; Gray recorded his own observations in the blank pages next to Linnaeus’s writing.
Linnaeus’s Note Cards
Much like his herbarium, Linnaeus required a flexible, expandable way to collect information on the different genera he catalogued. Thus, he began using small slips of paper (7.5 x 13.0 cm)—much like our modern index cards. In fact, Linnaeus was one of the first to use them. Whenever he learned of a new genus, he could easily add a notecard.
Linnaeus filled these paper slips with a fairly standard set of information about each species. He began with the genus name and then progressed to describe defining characteristics including descriptions of the stamen (STA), the piston (PIS) as well as observations (OBS).
The western honey-bee, or apis mellifera
We still categorize the natural world according to Linnaeus’s hierarchy (Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species). And we still name species according to Linnaeus’s binomial nomenclature. But none of his innovations in the realm of natural history would have come to pass without the enormous effort he put into his note-taking practices.
Notes on Linnaeus’s Notes
Think outside the bound book: I love a notebook as much as anyone, but they don’t work particularly well for accumulating information within discrete categories. If you want to keep similar information together (examples of plants with similar structures) then an infinitely-expandable system works best. And this system has generally been deployed with note-cards.
Drawings can only do so much: Many of Linnaeus’s biographers point out that he wasn’t the best illustrator. They claim this is one of the reasons why he did not recommend illustration as a way to capture information. Whether or not this is true, the fact remains that every drawing is only an interpretation—a two-dimensional representation of something that exists in the real world. I often think of notes in this way: Our notes are not the thing we are trying to capture, but our interpretation of that thing. Even a quotation represents our particular selection taken from a larger body of work.
Add blank pages to your books: We usually don’t purchase custom-made printed books today, so we can’t ask a publisher to interleave a book for us. However, we can add blank pages to books with sticky notes or even loose-leaf. How, I wonder, would we approach books if we were expected to write in them?

art,"At Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, Japan today during a panel celebrating 20 years of Lucasfilm Animation history, the studio confirmed its next big animated chapter will be none other than a Darth Maul series.
Carrying on a legacy that began with the 3DCG Clone Wars series, before carrying on into the likes of Rebels, Resistance, Bad Batch, and animated anthologies like the Tales series, Maul: Shadow Lord will follow Maul (played by returning Clone Wars and Rebels star Sam Witwer), seemingly as he builds out the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate. The trailer shown to gathered fans in the hall included various Criminal factions like the Pykes reeling from attacks on shipments, only for Maul to reveal himself as the architect. While the show’s look is a broad evolution of the art style seen in Clone Wars and later the Tales anthologies, there is also a new stylistic flourish in Shadow Lord‘s aesthetic that leans on rough lines and ragged edges, best glimpsed in Maul’s crimson saber blades, which look almost fiery in appearance.
One of the most interesting elements of the whole trailer was that Maul finds himself what appears to be a young new apprentice in the ways of the Force: a young Twi’lek girl he liberates from captivity and then begins teaching. Alongside her tutelage, we see shots of gang wars, intense chases through the hustle and bustle of a city planet (not unlike Coruscant, but would Maul really be playing in his old master’s back yard like that? We’ll have to wait and see), and even an encounter with the Inquisitorius in the form of Ahsoka‘s Marrok, who expresses his surprise that Maul has survived even as he draws sabers with him.
Maul: Shadow Lord will release in 2026.

NEW ORLEANS – A hero's welcome greets 18 women at the National World War Two Museum. Staff and museum visitors line a plaza, waving American flags and cheering as the women arrive, adorned in the red and white polka dot scarfs that are a signature of Rosie the Riveters.
They're here to be honored as Congressional Gold Medal recipients. But first, each Rosie gets a personal tour of the museum, starting in the home front exhibit.
""Look at the women welders, now that's a familiar job,"" says Jane Tucker, now 97. She left rural Lineville, Alabama in 1943, with her mom and sister to work in a shipyard.

""I worked in Savannah, Georgia building Liberty ships, and I learned to become a welder when I was just 16,"" Tucker says. ""It was all top secret. Loose lips will sink ships.""

She says they worked ten-hour days, at least six days a week.
Tucker was one of an estimated 5 million civilian women who worked in the defense industry and elsewhere while men were fighting overseas.

Tucker says they were trailblazers, proving that women can succeed in what was considered ""men's jobs"" at the time.
""The men said we couldn't do it,"" she recalls. ""They said, 'Oh, they're too emotional, they're too petty. They'll be sick a lot. They won't come to work and they'll be too weak to do the heavy work.' So we said 'we can do it!'""
""We Can Do It"" is the slogan on the iconic poster of a female factory worker, muscle flexed, and head wrapped in a red and white bandana.
Norman Rockwell's famous painting of a Rosie was on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post in 1943.

King, now 100 years old, says it took years for her to realize the role she played in American history.
""We did this because we wanted to win the war,"" says King. ""I think as I grew older and history of America begins to be told it's important.""

Bringing together an exciting lineup of 30 emerging and established artists, Halsey refuses white-cube sterility, and nurtures, as she puts it, “the spirit of a kiccbacc” – an opportunity for pleasure, rekindling old connections and cultivating new ones.
Spanning installation, painting, photography, mixed-media and sculptures, resonance thrives in its multiplicity. Each work takes root in Halsey’s ethos of community-driven creativity, and threaded together by the figuration of people, plants and animals as metaphors for interconnectedness, care and lived experience.
Best known for her large-scale foil collages, Halsey’s immersive installations braid real and imagined geographies to bring forth a mythology of her own. Fusing the raw visuals of South Central with ancient Egyptian iconography, her work culminates in speculative spaces, remixing personal history, ancestral knowledge and lost legacies.

art,"Read Travel St. Lucia’s Sugar Beach Is an Art Lover’s Paradise Art meets luxury at a Viceroy Hotels’ newest luxury villa with more than 100 contemporary works inside Rachel King By Rachel King
Art and luxury don’t always often share the same level of intent. Luxury often focuses on opulence and exclusivity, while art is more about creativity and thoughtfulness. But at Sugar Beach, A Viceroy Hotel in St. Lucia, the two are inseparable. And the resort’s long-awaited opening of its massive new villa, named “Spice of Life,” signals a deliberate effort to integrate contemporary works into high-end hospitality, making it one of the most ambitious private accommodations in the Caribbean.
Courtesy of Viceroy
The 35,000-square-foot residence, designed by Botelho Wood Architects in Bermuda, accommodates up to 18 guests and features art from Yayoi Kusama, Daniel Arsham, Jeff Koons, KAWS, Julian Opie and Tom Sachs—just to start. Unlike properties where artwork is an afterthought, the villa incorporated these pieces from the outset of construction.
“One of the things that makes this villa different is that it wasn’t just decorated with art—the entire space was built around it,” says James Wyndham, managing director of Sugar Beach. “Instead of selecting pieces to complement an existing structure, the architecture and interiors were planned to enhance and highlight the collection.”
This approach extends beyond the villa with more than 180 pieces situated across the larger property. (The Spice of Life villa has more than 110 inside on its own.) The artworks can be found not only in common areas but also in other guest accommodations. Imagine seeing a Damien Hirst painting in your bathroom. At Sugar Beach, that’s the norm, not the exception.
Courtesy of Viceroy
Guests can not only get up-close-and-personal with these multimillion-dollar pieces, but they can also take themselves on a self-guided art tour. Each installation has a blink-and-you-miss-it placard with a QR code, which loads a description of the artwork in the phone’s default browser. (And Wi-Fi is free and abundant throughout the property with little to no hassle.)
Courtesy of Viceroy
The significance of incorporating art at this scale raises questions about how high-end hospitality is changing. Luxury is often synonymous with excess, so some hotels and resorts have sought to redefine what exclusivity means. Rather than relying on traditional displays of opulence, Sugar Beach’s management sees artistic curation as an extension of cultural engagement.
Courtesy of Viceroy
The art collection is positioned alongside a focus on locally sourced materials from St. Lucia and around the Caribbean. Wyndham notes that the region is recognized for its skilled carpenters and stone masons, and thus the villa incorporated these techniques and materials into its construction. Hardwood and stone are used throughout, aligning with broader efforts to maintain a connection to St. Lucia’s architectural traditions.
Sustainability measures include rainwater collection systems for irrigation and bathroom use. The resort also has over 300 solar panels contributing to its energy supply and solar-powered street lights that provide assistance to local fishermen.
By Rachel King
“St. Lucia as a whole is still developing its recycling and environmental initiatives,” Wyndham acknowledges. “That being said, there is a strong commitment to making progress in this area, and we are very much aligned with that effort.”
Sugar Beach has also positioned itself as an active participant in community engagement. The resort is one of the largest supporters of the nearby Soufrière Hospital and has funded multiple educational programs in the area. By sourcing materials and labor locally, the property aims to ensure that its investment in design and infrastructure benefits the surrounding economy.
Courtesy of Viceroy
The integration of art within private residences and hotels is not unique to Sugar Beach. Other high-end hotels and resorts around the world have taken similar approaches. The Rosewood São Paulo, for example, incorporates over 450 commissioned pieces by Brazilian artists in the Philippe Starck-designed hotel, presenting itself as both a hotel and a functioning gallery space. Similarly, Le Royal Monceau Raffles Paris has a contemporary art gallery onsite, open to guests, art collectors and general visitors alike with exclusive pieces and frequent art shows, with even more pieces from the hotel’s private collection scattered throughout the lobby and hallways. And the gallery at the Fairmont Pacific Rim in Vancouver rotates exhibitions quarterly, showcasing primarily Canadian contemporary artists.
Courtesy of Viceroy
The focus on art and sustainability reflects a shift in expectations for luxury hospitality. A 2021 study found that 81% of travelers planned to choose sustainable accommodation options in the coming year, indicating a growing desire for more meaningful experiences. Travelers are increasingly seeking environments that are immersive rather than purely ornamental. The presence of original, high-profile works offers a differentiating factor in a competitive market, particularly as hotels move away from neutral, standardized designs.
Courtesy of Viceroy
“We’re not just modern luxury, we’re young luxury,” Wyndham says, emphasizing targeting a younger demographic. This emphasis on contemporary art reflects a broader generational shift in the definition of high-end travel. For many, a luxury stay is no longer about the predictability of five-star service but about an atmosphere that fosters creativity and conversation.
“By definition, art is intended to elicit emotions and personal responses, so we are mindful of including various mediums and types of art that warrant a spectrum of feelings,” says Jeff Toscano, CEO of Aspen Hospitality (which includes The Little Nell and Limelight Hotels). Toscano notes that the luxury group tracks guest feedback on every part of the hotel experience—especially art. “As a hospitality organization, guest satisfaction is our number one priority, so any and all art that we integrate into our hotels must positively enhance the energy of the spaces.”
Courtesy of Viceroy
While the art collection at Sugar Beach is extensive, the extent to which it influences the guest experience remains subjective. The degree to which travelers engage with these pieces will vary, and some may see it as an enhancement, while others may not consider it a defining element of their stay. Consumer willingness to support sustainable practices is evident, though it varies. A 2024 survey revealed that 6% of consumers worldwide would be willing to pay more than 50% extra to stay at sustainable hotels, while 44% indicated they would not pay more for such accommodations.
As the luxury travel sector continues to evolve, the intersection of contemporary art and hospitality is likely to become more pronounced. Whether or not this model is sustainable over the long term remains to be seen, particularly as trends in both art and travel are constantly shifting. After all, while hotel management didn’t provide a specific figure, Sugar Beach’s art collection was estimated to be in the “hundreds of millions of dollars” range. That kind of investment just isn’t achievable or realistic for many properties without an outside art collector with deep pockets involved.
Courtesy of Viceroy
However, the pointed inclusion of art within any given resort’s broader design will likely set it apart from properties where such features are confined to common areas.
“The integration of art into hotel design is a lasting shift,” Toscano says. “Luxury hotels are intended to be the best versions of home, and many of our guests have carefully curated their art collections at home.”",0.9991,positive
art,"Field Notes debuts a new notebook inspired by 1950s sign design, featuring bold colors and iconic graphic design details.
Field Notes has long built its brand around craftsmanship and nostalgia. With its latest Quarterly Edition, “The Chicago Look,” the Chicago-based company leans into graphic design history, channeling the energy and optimism of post-WWII signage into a new 6×8” format. For designers and creatives, it’s a tactile tribute to a golden era of visual communication.
A nod to the Beverly Sign Co.
The edition is inspired by the Beverly Sign Co., a now-defunct outfit that made its mark in the 1950s and ’60s. Known for panelized layouts, bold letterforms, and high-contrast palettes, Beverly Sign Co. helped shape what came to be called the “Chicago Look.” It was a style that didn’t just stay local — it influenced commercial sign painters across the U.S.
Field Notes’ team discovered this design legacy through The Golden Era of Sign Design by Kelsey Dalton McClellan and Andrew McClellan. The book archives original sketches, notes, and swatches that guided painters — also known as “wall dogs” — as they hand-lettered storefronts and billboards. These hand-drawn artifacts, rich with penciled-in feedback and vibrant color studies, served as the launchpad for this edition’s visual identity.
Designed to feel like a working document
To capture the spirit of those original proofs, Field Notes brought in the McClellans and fellow sign painter Bob Behounek to design two covers that echo the look and feel of an in-progress sign. The covers are printed on Westrock Tango C1S 16pt stock, featuring diagonal color swatches and textured notes — a direct reference to the original documentation used by sign painters.
Each notebook includes 64 pages of Domtar Lynx Opaque paper, with a light-blue grid printed in soy-based ink. The decision to scale up from the standard size to a larger 6×8” format gives designers more room to sketch, ideate, and build — a functional choice that also elevates the presence of the historic reference.
A graphic design collectible
At $14.95 for a 2-pack, “The Chicago Look” is more than a stationery release — it’s a mini design archive. Subscribers to Field Notes’ Quarterly Edition also receive a 2.25” “Wall Dogs Forever” pin and a postcard of one of the covers as a full-sized, hand-painted sign now installed at Field Notes HQ.
In a time when much of graphic design lives on screens, this collection reconnects creatives with physical process and historical context. It celebrates the analog precision of mid-century sign painters — those who shaped cityscapes with brushes, not pixels.
For designers looking to get inspired by the roots of visual branding, this edition delivers a rare mix of design history, material beauty, and functionality.

With season 2 of Severance complete (with a remarkable bang), Apple TV+ has slid right into a new prestige series, The Studio, starring (and co-created by) Seth Rogen as the newly-appointed chief of the fictional and dysfunctional Continental Studios in Hollywood.
Two episodes in (out of 10 for the debut season), and it is fucking amazing. So far it feels a bit like a cross between Entourage, The Larry Sanders Show, Boogie Nights, and maybe a touch of Curb Your Enthusiasm. But the biggest influence and inspiration is clearly Robert Altman’s 1992 masterpiece The Player, almost certainly the best Hollywood movie about Hollywood moviemaking that ever was or will be made.
What The Studio and The Player share is that they’re about the struggle to create great cinematic art within a corporate studio world run by unartistic know-it-all self-important status-obsessed dullards driven by formula and fads — and, simultaneously, they are themselves almost unfathomably complicated and intricate works of cinematic art. They are what they’re about. They achieve what the characters within them fear is no longer achievable. When you get to episode 2 of The Studio, just keep asking yourself “Wait, how are they getting this shot?” The lighting, my god. The whole thing is just an outpouring of homage to the opening shot of The Player, which of course itself calls back, explicitly, to Orson Welles’s Touch of Evil.
The Studio is, thus far, engaging, surprising, funny, gorgeous, clever, and cinematically ambitious. It’s really quite a thing. I have no idea what’s coming in episodes 3–10, so maybe this piece will look a bit premature, if not foolish, in two months. But if the rest of season one is anything like the first two episodes, The Studio is a classic in the making.
The thought also occurs to me that this might be the don’t-over-think-it answer to just what the hell Apple is doing making original shows and movies in the first place. Perhaps Apple’s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but champions. And that in a media landscape where such champions of cinema-as-art and art-as-an-essential-public-good are fewer and fewer, it is Apple’s not just opportunity but obligation to step up to the plate.
I’ve long thought that one of the minor tragedies of Steve Jobs’s second act is that the timing just didn’t work out to sell Pixar to Apple, instead of to Disney. But make no mistake, a love and appreciation for great cinema is not outside Apple’s DNA. No streamer has a higher hit rate for quality shows. Their movies mostly stink so far, but maybe that’s just the learning curve. The Gorge, for example, feels like an Apple TV movie because it’s so decidedly meh. Not horrible, but not good in any way beyond its intriguing elevator-pitch concept. Wolfs was better but still a grand disappointment given its pedigree. But when it comes to shows, no one is doing better. Severance deserves all its acclaim and attention, and Ben Stiller delivered a season 2 finale that’s arguably the best 78 minutes of filmmaking I’ve seen this decade. And The Studio, to me, feels like an Apple TV show — not because of how it looks, what it’s about, or who’s in it, but simply because it’s so good. Netflix almost never makes shows like this. Neither does HBO now that’s its been subsumed by “Max”. Peacock et al don’t even try.1",0.9983,positive

art,"Every parent, teacher, or caregiver knows the heart-stopping moment of discovering colorful artwork extending beyond paper onto walls, furniture, or clothing. Children’s artistic exploration naturally knows no boundaries, with their creative impulses often resulting in permanent decorations where they’re least wanted. These artistic mishaps, while showcasing a child’s developing creativity, can lead to frustrating cleanup sessions and sometimes damaged surfaces that no amount of scrubbing can restore.
While digital tablets have revolutionized how children interact with art, most fail to capture the fundamental joy of color mixing that traditional paints provide. Current devices typically offer pre-selected color palettes or digital brushes that don’t mimic the natural blending experience of physical media. Children miss out on the magical discovery of watching blue and yellow transform into green or experiencing how adding white creates lighter tints of their favorite colors: essential learning experiences in color theory and artistic development.
Designer: Yifeeling Design
The HueHub concept reimagines digital art for young creators by combining tablet technology with the tactile experience of traditional painting. Unlike standard tablets, HueHub features a specialized layout with a main drawing canvas and an innovative side panel containing three primary color blocks of red, yellow, and blue, plus a dedicated mixing area where children can blend these colors to create endless combinations. This thoughtful design bridges the gap between digital convenience and traditional artistic discovery.
What makes this concept truly special is how it simulates a painter’s palette experience in the digital realm. Children can “dip” their stylus into virtual paint, mix colors in the dedicated tray, and apply their custom-created hues to their artwork, all without the mess of traditional paints. The software would recreate realistic paint behaviors like blending and texture, helping children understand color relationships while keeping floors and furniture pristine. Parents get peace of mind while children enjoy the full sensory experience of creating art.
Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the HueHub concept is its color-capturing stylus that could “pick up” colors from real-world objects. Imagine a child fascinated by the exact shade of a flower petal or autumn leaf being able to capture that precise color for their digital masterpiece. This feature would create a meaningful connection between digital art and the physical world, encouraging children to observe their surroundings more closely and bring those observations into their creative work.
The HueHub concept represents a thoughtful approach to children’s digital art tools that respects how children naturally learn about color and creativity. By combining the cleanliness and convenience of digital media with the experiential learning of traditional painting, this device could transform how young artists develop their skills. Although just a concept, the technologies that could make this possible already exist and can paint, pardon the pun, a future where technology enhances rather than replaces the fundamental artistic experiences that help children understand their colorful world.",0.9964,positive
art,"By Maria Martinez
BERLIN (Reuters) - The Art House Tacheles used to be the epicentre of the alternative art and culture scene in Berlin, an impressive five-storey building in the heart of the capital dating back to 1908 and occupied by artists after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
But in 2012 the raves were over and the artists were kicked out when the building was sold to a New York investor and renovated to make room for apartments, offices, stores, a supermarket and a Swedish photography museum.
For Oliver Putzbach, a 52-year-old Berlin native who used to live nearby, Tacheles' transformation symbolises that of the capital itself.
While its economy grows and investment capital pours in, long-time residents like Putzbach fear it is losing its edgy character and bohemian charm that had its former mayor famously declaring over two decades ago that Berlin was “poor but sexy.""
""It looks the same as a typical train station in Germany ...just like a mall,"" Putzbach said about the building he remembers as a multicultural village where he used to perform with his band Beat Organization three times a week.
""Berlin has sold its soul,"" he said.
For decades, Berlin stood out among European capitals, poorer than the rest of the country because of its unique history as a divided city and its costly reunification.
For the past 10 years, however, the capital's growth has outpaced the sluggish overall performance of Europe's largest economy.
Last year, Berlin's economy grew by 0.8% while the national one contracted for the second year in a row, data showed on Friday. As a result, Berlin's economic output per capita, which long lagged that of Germany, moved further above the national average, with 54,607 euros and 50,819 euros, respectively.
""Berlin was not wealthy, but that became the foundation for getting richer: Berlin attracted young talent who came here to reshape their lives and make their ideas reality,"" said Martin Gornig, researcher at the German Institute for Economic Research DIW Berlin.
The city has become Germany's startup capital, overtaking Munich with around 500 companies founded each year, and digital consumer services companies, such as e-commerce group Zalando or fintech N-26, calling Berlin home.
Tesla's gigafactory about an hour away and the city's new airport that opened in 2020 after multiple delays, also brought thousands of new jobs to the area.
Berlin's unique blend of high culture, counterculture and history has also made it a major tourism destination, Europe's third behind London and Paris in terms of overnight stays.",0.8789,positive

art,"Valerya Milovanova is a UK-based illustrator who combines traditional materials with digital media like Procreate to make fun and heartwarming illustrations. She also loves screen printing, monoprinting and RISO techniques to enhances her storytelling.
Before we go on, and if you're inspired by Valerya, then read our list of Procreate tutorials to get started in this app, and our guide to the best iPads for drawing. Read our xTool Screen Printer review too, for a device to get started in this craft.
Back to Valerya, and she uses her sketchbooks in an ""unconventional"" way. They're more of a tool to achieve unique and unexpected textures and brushstrokes that are then transferred to the Procreate app. All her illustrations begin on paper, where she feels more free to experiment and assists happy accidents.
""I graduated from the University of Hertfordshire's Illustration course in 2023 and applied to several picturebook illustration agencies seeking representation. Advocate Art has responded quite promptly and I have been working with them for almost two years since,"" shares Valerya. Take a look at Valerya's work on her website.
She adds: ""I have also participated in several illustration competitions during my studies, such as the Batsford Prize, and later that year the Unpublished Picturebook showcase. Being shortlisted for those awards helped me kickstart my career and opened a path for new opportunities.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
I ask Valerya about her distinctive process of starting illustrations in her sketchbook and then finishing them in Procreate.
""I usually start with a physical drawing on paper with watercolour, gouache, charcoal pencils, and sometimes ink,"" she says.
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
She adds: ""The digital process for me consists of colour editing (through curves and colour balance in Procreate) and then I draw over the painting with digital brushes. And if I start with a black and white ink painting, I first colour it to achieve the desired look with Multiply and Overlay layers.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
Valerya specifies: ""My favourite brush is definitely the Freycinet Brush from the drawing category – I use it basically for everything, the literary and the colour, it has great texture and mixes perfectly with the watercolour texture. I almost just recently started making my own brushes from my watercolour scans, which helps achieve a cohesive look.""
I ask her to point out the main aspects she focuses on in the traditional stage, ""Texture, composition, values, and colours are the most important ones for me,"" she says.
She continues: ""The latter could of course be edited digitally, but I still like to think about how colours interact with each other and how they blend creating smooth gradients. And I try to not make the traditional paintings too polished – so there is some looseness and life left in them. I don't want to overwork them, there is beauty in imperfection!""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
Since texture is very important for Valerya, I ask her what combination of tools and media allows her to achieve it, and she replies, ""Watercolour, ink, charcoal, coloured pencils, and gouache (still testing it out)"".
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
She continues: ""I like mixing blues and greens and combining translucent textures (like ink and watercolour) with more thick ones (like gouache). Also charcoal helps adding the final touches, smudges, shading.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
I ask Valerya how did you develop a sketchbook routine and how do you manage to stay consistent?
""I do carry a small sketchbook with me everywhere, but I still don't use it every time. It's nice to have it and draw on the way home after meeting with friends, or while waiting for a coffee and a bun, or at the busy London pub where people won't notice you are spying on them,"" she says.
She then adds: ""I think I can work on being more consistent with my sketchbook practice, as sometimes I just don't have the energy to create after working on books.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
I ask her about her sources of inspiration, ""It could be something I saw on my walk, a picture I took, a film, or a book,"" Valerya says.
But what if you can't come up with anything? ""The ideas come to me when I'm most relaxed, so I try to not force myself into creating but rather allow myself to rest, and observe the world around me freely,"" reflects Valerya.
She adds: ""Sometimes I search for references online – I often find a picture that inspire me on Pinterest, and then I think of my own way of interpreting the same narrative, colour palette, composition, or whatever caught my eye.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
I ask Valerya to point out her favorite pages, ''Definitely the most spontaneous ones, where I drew quickly, trying to grasp the form and the character of a person,"" she says.
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
""Here I was not actively thinking about the strokes or the materials, but rather about capturing the unexpected gesture, emotion, and posture. I sketched these people on my way home in the underground, and coloured them later,"" she describes.
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
Valerya says, ""I think I managed to capture the essence of the flowers without overworking them, love the looseness and textures!"" (You can find more of them on Valerya's Instagram page.)
Artists usually have more than one sketchbook so I want to know how many sketchbooks Valerya uses at a time. And which are the goals for each of them?
""I currently have two main sketchbooks,"" Valerya says, then adds: ""One is a tiny A6 book with thinner paper that I take everywhere. It is mainly for the people watching in the underground, at the cafe, or during art fairs. It also sometimes works for testing the materials.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
She continues: ""The other sketchbook is not a sketchbook at all, or at least when I'm finished with it. It starts with an A4 mixed media pad, where I draw the textures, backgrounds, and separate characters for the books.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
She says: ""Here I did a lot of character sketches for the Your Marvellous Masterpiece picture book. I've also created many ink textures that were later scanned and applied to the final illustrations in Procreate. As I need to scan the pages one by one I tear the pad apart, and thus I have a collection of A4 pages just lying around.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
But it hasn't been always like that. ""Back when I was a child and just started learning how to draw independently from the art school, I had a huge collection of sketchbooks and I used to finish them in a month or two. I was so motivated to learn all the techniques, play with the materials, and explore what styles I could do that I made a rule for myself – no starting a new sketchbook until the current one was finished, that way I was committed and motivated, and got a sense of accomplishment after each one,"" Valerya adds.
There are many sketchbook challenges going on on social media at the moment, so I'm curious to know if she took part in any of these.
""I have participated in a few of them over the years. But I think I have only finished one - the Inktober. I guess working with ink and B&W materials has its own limitations, and having those limitations helps overcome the fear of imperfection. With fewer choices to agonise over – no colours to blend, no complex mediums to experiment with, I'm forced to focus on the essentials: composition, contrast, and line work. Instead of getting stuck on making everything ""perfect,"" I just keep moving forward, embracing the spontaneity of ink.""
She continues: ""The Mermay or Peachtober challenges just didn't stick – too much pressure and freedom for everyday drawings, especially if you have illustration work besides the challenge.
""I did actually create a few of my own sketchbook challenges – like drawing women in different outfits for 30 days or painting simple ink images and printing them on Riso right away. These helped me stay consistent, and the themes were something I was truly interested in.""
(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)
I ask Valerya what skills she has improved the most by practicing consistently in her sketchbook?
""Line confidence and the ability to observe and capture shapes quickly are the biggest skills I've improved the most. The more I sketch, the less hesitant my strokes are. I’ve learned to trust my hand and commit to marks without overthinking. And I've learned to trust the materials and allow the 'happy mistakes' to happen, as they make the final piece more genuine, more unexpected, and surprising even for me.""

art,"This issue of the art newsletter comes from GoldenEye, the resort on Oracabessa Bay, Jamaica, that was built around the villa where Ian Fleming wrote most of his James Bond novels. For twenty years GoldenEye has hired me to do their hand-painted signage and graphics; this time I brought my daughter and worked on closing the Spring Books issue by the lagoon. The days alternated between sunny skies and downpours, and the water, orchids, and trees shimmered in the humidity.
The cover of our April 10 issue is a 2021 painting by the New York artist Scott Csoke. It refers to Wendy Doniger’s essay about the history of war horses. After trying several varieties of art about horses, we landed on Csoke’s Antique Portrait of a Gay Horse (Head) (2021). The painting had never been properly photographed, so Csoke borrowed it from its owner and met me at a coffee shop, carrying the portrait in a tote bag so that I could scan it. Csoke’s pink-trimmed, hand-painted apartment was recently featured in New York magazine.
To illustrate Howard French’s essay about the books and ideas of Alvin Toffler, the futurist and author of Future Shock, I asked Michelle Mildenberg. She drew a “young Toffler seen from the back looking at a spiral of technological imagery from China.” Before she delivered the final proof, I asked her to change the color of his shirt from brown to green. And for Cathleen Schine’s review of Hanif Kureshi’s recent memoir about an accident that left him tetraplegic, I asked Carly Blumenthal for a portrait. Her fine-grained pencil-crayon rendering feels as intimate as Schine’s descriptions of Kureshi’s patient, careful writing.
For her third portrait for us, the London-based illustrator Ruby Ash drew the Argentine writer Hebe Uhart seated on a bus, a scene from Natasha Wimmer’s essay about Uhart’s travel writing. When I sent a draft of Jonathan Mingle’s essay about phosphorous and soil nutrients to Jason Logan, he looked up the element and then texted me: “I read that there is phosphorus in the striker of matches and in the tip of some safety matches, and I had some ingredients left over from my tests with gunpowder.” We used his abstract Sulphur Test to accompany Mingle’s article.
I asked the Toronto-based illustrator Natàlia Pàmies Lluís for a portrait of the Chilean writer Benjamín Labatut for Dan Rockmore’s review of his books The MANIAC and When We Cease to Understand the World. It was her first portrait for us, and she explained that she “wanted to visually explore destruction and madness, incorporating elements like an explosion emerging from his hair.”

The Spring Books issue means it’s time for one of our four annual hand-lettered and hand-drawn covers. I’d been wanting to work with Maria-Ines Gul since 2020, when Kaye Blegvad sent me a zine of Gul’s erotic drawings (a few of which I used to illustrate Elaine Blair’s 2023 essay about porn). When I asked Gul to illustrate our Spring Books cover, she sent a number of gorgeous sketches evoking the mood of the season, including abstract weather patterns, the sunlit facade of a building, and a cup of clouds, which is what we decided on. Gul titled her cover Clouds in My Coffee.
Andrea Ventura painted the historian Catherine Hall for Fara Dabhoiwala’s essay about her life and work, but when Ventura turned in the final image, we decided that we actually preferred his initial sketch. He took no offence, writing, “I understand. I love that about drawings, when you are less aware it’s better.” In the case of Romy Blümel’s lush portrait of Katie Kitamura, for Laura Marsh’s review of Kitamura’s new novel, Audition, we made a few edits before landing on the final.
The London-based illustrator Paul Davis wrote to say that it “made his day” to be assigned Fintan O’Toole’s essay about the president and the EU, and after a little back and forth, he delivered a grumpy Trump straddling Europe and tearing the EU flag. For Francisco Cantú’s review of The Afterlife Is Letting Go, Brandon Shimoda’s book about Japanese internment and the US’s history of migrant detention, I looked for a painting by the Japanese artist Hiroki Kawanabe that could allude to the themes of disconnection and the erosion of history. His painting Wide Street (2024) seemed to convey the appropriate sense of isolation.

Georgie McAusland drew the novelist and poet Joe Dunthorne for Francine Prose’s review of his latest book, which details the story of his great-grandfather, a Jewish scientist who, in the 1930s, developed chemical weapons for the Nazis. McAusland included the writer’s Geiger counter in her portrait, alongside cloudy likenesses of his ancestors, which, as one editor pointed out, echoed the cover in an uncanny way. Yann Kebbi and his mighty pencil gave us a vigorous drawing of Larry McMurtry to illustrate Thomas Powers’s essay about the writer’s life and, in particular, Lonesome Dove.
I asked the photographer Jason Fulford if he had any images that might be appropriate for David Cole’s article about academic freedom. To my delight he had a series of pictures from Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, including some shots of the two-sided “Erase/Do Not Erase” signs that professors use for classroom blackboards. A simple “Do Not Erase” conveyed Cole’s point in a wonderful way.
In his review of a new book by the philosopher Thomas Nagel, Peter Singer writes about moral progress and decision making. The artist Greg Burak recently had a show, Psychologistics, at New York’s March Gallery, and I thought some of his de Chirico–esque work could be a good fit. Instead, we went with a painting of his from 2022, The Candidate, depicting two figures holding candles, one of them blindfolded. Burak’s 2020 painting Two Curses was on the cover of our November 18, 2021, issue.

art,"Staatsgalerie Stuttgart is getting a chromatic makeover with The Sprayed Dear, the latest solo exhibition by celebrated German artist Katharina Grosse. Based between Berlin and New Zealand, Grosse has spent over three decades redefining what painting can be, moving beyond the canvas to embrace entire landscapes, buildings and sculptural form.
For Grosse, a painting has no end nor edge. Using her signature spray technique, she sweeps pigment across surfaces in immersive dreamlike waves whose borderless forms create a harmonic unity. “For me, two-dimensional painting doesn’t exist,” the artist explained. “The canvas itself is a three-dimensional, haptic object and a painting can appear anywhere. On an egg, in the crook of your arm, in snow and ice or on the beach.”
Circling this philosophy are three new works, produced especially for the show. Among them is the titular piece, The Sprayed Dear, which references the golden stag atop the museum and plays on the word “dear” as something treasured. Also on view are Ghost, a massive white styrofoam sculpture exploring surface and shape, and Untitled, which reveals the sculptural soul of Grosse’s canvas paintings. Complementing these works are rarely seen early sculptures from her student years at the Düsseldorf Art Academy, shedding light on a lesser-known dimension of her practice.
Alongside the exhibition, Grosse’s magnetic color fields will be the focus of this year’s Messeplatz Project at Art Basel’s marquee fair in June.
The Sprayed Dear is now on view in Stuttgart through January 2026.

Room 8 is a room in Blue Prince that you can only unlock with Key 8 on rank 8. You’ll find that key by solving the Gallery puzzle(s).
In Room 8, you’ll have to puzzle out clues on eight animal statues and place them in eight bins labeled with sins.
Our Blue Prince guide will show you how to solve the Room 8 puzzle and tell you what you get as a reward.
How to solve the Room 8 puzzle in Blue Prince
Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon
Room 8 is a pretty exact match for the final painting in the Gallery. You’ll find a big infinity symbol in the center of the room surrounded by bins labeled with sins. There’s a painting of a fin on the left wall, and a rug (skin) on the floor (those are both clues you’ll need).
To the left of the door as you walk in, you’ll find eight animal statues with phrases on them.
Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon
Solving the puzzle in Room 8 is a simple (ha!) as placing the eight animal statues in the boxes their clue describes. Several of them have clues that point to multiple bins, though.
The clues are:
Penguin : The sum of my sin, as it is penned, is a number within the room we are in
Lion : To first begin, place me within a bin with an “N” within its sin
Swan : I recommend you think again if I am ever in a bin far from the fin
Dog : You won’t find my bin in between sin, for I deserve to be in a bin down on the end
Elephant : To my chagrin, my neighbor’s sin is written thin to fit it all in
Rabbit : I share a trend with my neighbor’s sin: a letter and its twin appear on each bin
Bear : If we spend a min or ten lounging in the den, you’ll know which bin I’m often in
Monkey: The bin I tend to wind up in is near the bend in the tail of the skin
Room 8 solution in Blue Prince
You have to jump around a bit, but the list of clues only has one answer when you take them all together.
Four of the clues point to only one bin:
Penguin - GLUTTONY . This is the only sin with eight (sideways infinity) letters.
Monkey - HUBRIS . The bin next to the tail of the skin (rug).
Dog - MUNDANITY . Since the Monkey is in HUBRIS, the Dog has to go in MUNDANITY at the other end of the row of bins.
Bear - SLOTH. The bear’s clue is all about just hanging out and relaxing.
With those four in place, you can place two more:
Lion - ENVY . With those three out of the way, only one empty sin has an “N.”
Swan - LUST. This is the only bin left that is close to the painting of the fin.
The last two have a bit more logic involved:
Rabbit - AVARICE . AVARICE is next to MUNDANITY — which both have a repeated (twin) letter (A and N, respectively).
Elephant - WRATH. Aside from being the only empty bin, AVARICE is next to Gluttony with its (fittingly) narrow letters.

art,"Thomas James’s post-apocalyptic and fantasy models may differ in medium, but each is a detailed work of art. Whether he’s crafting cardboard robot costumes with friends to march in a parade, handcrafting tabletop terrain for Dungeons & Dragons games, or 3D printing resin miniatures, there’s something delightful and surprising in each piece.
He hesitated to think of himself as a “serious maker” because his work seemed too broad. Unsure if there was a niche interested in models, miniatures, props, handcrafting, 3D printing, and more, he held off on starting a YouTube channel. Eventually, he realized that “being an eclectic, multi-disciplinary maker IS my niche. I enjoy becoming obsessed with so many creative pursuits. That’s just who I am, and that’s what makes me happy.”
My favorite project so far was forming the Beep Boop Beep Robot Brigade. I got a group of friends together to make our own robot costumes out of cardboard and found objects and marched for three years in the local annual parade. We even won 1st place in the Novelty category one year. Getting ready to march and looking around at everyone’s costumes brought me so much joy. It was amazing to see everyone jump on board the idea and really go for it.

Thomas was a Creative Director, Graphic Designer, and Illustrator for 16 years and has “reached the end of my mental rope with my previous career in corporate marketing design,” and is working hard to turn modelmaking into his full-time career. To that end, he started that YouTube channel and is sharing his handmade projects as Alchemy of Craft.
The tour of his playable medieval house is encouraging and has some solid tips for anyone dreaming of making something similar. His post-apocalyptic sidekick costume for his dog Winnie looks amazing, and the video’s hilarious. It also proves he has a very tolerant dog.
Like pretty much all of us, he wants to upgrade his workshop, tools, and skills (there’s a good book for that last one). He’s aiming to make “bigger and bolder projects with an emphasis on pageantry and giving people amazing experiences”.
“A dice tower made out of a broken gumball machine (my favorite project so far in 2025).”
He shares the following words of wisdom for readers, “Embrace whatever creative drive you have. Listen to your heart and your mind when it’s telling you what you love and what you want to spend your days doing. It’s the best way to find happiness in your life.”

art,"Last week the FBI raided the Miami Fine Art Gallery in Florida for allegedly selling forged art including artworks they falsely authenticated as real paintings by the late Pop Art icon, Andy Warhol. The outpost is owned by the art dealer, Leslie Roberts, who has been charged in federal court for “conspiring to sell forged art,” as per Artnet. “The 62-year-old dealer used fraudulent invoices and authentication documents to sell the works, officials claim.”
Accompanying Roberts in charges is a 37-year old man named Carlos Miguel Rodriguez Melendez who was hit with charges for wire fraud that linked to the forged artwork . Both individuals were arrested, but as of now, are free on bail with a slated April 21 arraignment. If they’re found guilty, the pair face up to 20 years in federal prison.
The indictment stated that Roberts relayed the pieces as original paintings connected to the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts. Melendez seemingly claimed that he worked at an auction house in New York to convince the victims into thinking that the works were authentic.
“To make the fraudulent art appear to be authentic pieces created by Andy Warhol, Leslie Howard Roberts utilized forged authentication documents that were purportedly provided by the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board, Inc.,” as per the indictment.
The New York Times reported that one of the victims was a family of art collectors, Matthew, Judy and Richard Perlman with the family having filed a civil lawsuit against Roberts claiming that he enticed them to pay over $6 million USD for the bootleg Warhols. “The Perelman family acquired more than 250 works, and paid $325,000 USD for a collection of depictions of Mao Zedong, one of Warhol’s most popular subjects.",-0.9083,negative
art,"Summer barbecue vibes ... but make it art. In 2021, Toronto-based curator Erin Storus founded Garden Variety, a project that transformed her backyard into an exhibition space. Here, visitors attend Garden Variety II, a one-day event held in July of 2021. (Garden Variety)
It was the summer of 2021, and Toronto was still in pandemic mode, weathering a lockdown that would become the longest of its kind. Erin Storus was living in the Annex that year, renting an apartment in a shared house on Markham Street. She was unemployed and unsure about the future, and yet, Storus felt lucky. She had something most downtown residents pined for: her own private patch of green space. ""We had this big beautiful backyard that was a total mess,"" says Storus, and amid the weeds and ankle-high grass, she saw potential.
For a single day that July, Storus transformed her urban oasis into an outdoor exhibition called Garden Variety . She had zero past experience as a curator. She didn't even know the artists. But when she pitched her idea, everyone said yes.
When exhibition day came, Storus strung gelatin lampshades by Shannon Garden-Smith in the trees, witchy lanterns which glowed amber as the afternoon sun faded to dusk. (Last year, Garden-Smith's monumental floor installation for Nuit Blanche was among the standout works of the night.) On the weather-beaten fence, she hung prints by Alison Postma , an award-winning artist and furniture designer whose work had previously shown as part of the Contact Photography Festival. And SK Maston , a local artist who would later exhibit at the Bonavista Biennale, literally dug her contributions into the lawn, creating small ponds around the yard. These glistening portals revealed ghostly paintings of enormous moths.

""The idea was kind of a community barbecue, but instead of, you know, hot dogs and hamburgers and corn, it's art,"" says Storus. By her estimate, around 200 people saw the show that day — turning up because they got a tip from a pal, or maybe saw the scene from their window next door. ""It ended up being the best thing I've ever done,"" says Storus of the show, and by the end of that summer, she'd hosted two more.
Since Garden Variety's inaugural year, Storus has both finished a masters degree and launched a career as a professional curator, doing exhibitions for the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto and the Plumb among other venues, and this July, she'll revive her project in a new location near Dundas and Gladstone. (She's since moved out of the place on Markham Street.) Like past editions, each Garden Variety show will be a one-day event, funded by Storus and reliant on volunteers to bring it to life. The first exhibition of the season is scheduled for July 5, and will feature site-specific work by the artists Leeay Aikawa, Danan Lake, Joy Wong, Derek Liddington, Emma Welch and Jaime McCuaig.
The experience of discovering contemporary art in somebody's backyard can conjure a feeling of magic and novelty, but there's a long tradition of upstart artists and curators transforming their homes into ad-hoc exhibition space. Projects of this scrappy nature are often fleeting, evolving into something bigger or more formal. Others eventually run their course when the passion and/or savings run down. Still, these venues are everywhere in Canada, and some believe their number will only increase as the cost of living continues to climb.
When your apartment doubles as an art gallery

Saving on rent isn't the only reason the model persists, though according to artist and curator Marie Ségolène Brault , founder of Espace Maurice , it's definitely a major factor. ""Montreal is no longer as affordable as it was even, like, 10 years ago. So if young people want to show their work, they're going to have to get creative,"" she says.
That's exactly what Brault did in 2021, when she opened Espace Maurice, a gallery she runs out of her loft apartment in the city's Gay Village. ""I knew right away when I moved in that I wanted to do this here,"" says Brault. The layout of the space is in an L-shape, she explains, with room for exhibitions near the entrance. ""If you turn the corner, then it's my home."" Since launching, Brault estimates she's organized more than 20 exhibitions for her gallery, paying most of the operating costs herself. (She affords it by working in the film industry as a props buyer.)

Four years into the endeavour, Brault has become increasingly interested in curating for venues that are not her living room, but she hasn't tired of hosting an open house every weekend. There's a big dining table in the centre of her apartment, she says, and sometimes she'll find herself sitting there with a stranger, sharing a quiet moment. ""It's very, I don't know — very poetic,"" she says. Experiences like that have been a bonus, it seems. At the beginning, Brault was motivated by more practical concerns. Like Storus at Garden Variety, she was at the beginning of her career as a curator. And with job opportunities looking scarce, she created her own, inspired by the apartment galleries she'd visited while studying in Chicago.
A gallery where the next-door neighbours are regulars
Danica Pinteric, a Toronto-based writer and curator, had a similarly formative experience. While studying in Montreal, visits to Vie d'ange, a project space in an old autobody shop, ignited her imagination. (The space, which was founded by curators Eli Kerr and Daphné Boxer, closed in 2019.) ""Just kind of going for it and not waiting for permission really inspired me,"" says Pinteric, who ran her own garage gallery in Montreal ( Calaboose ) before moving home to Toronto.
She launched Joys gallery there in 2022. The venue is a renovated garage (the former home of Tap Art Space), and during the warm-weather months, Joys hosts exhibitions, readings and other events — partly supported by grants and funds raised through an annual artist calendar. ""If we don't get the grant, we'll still do [the show]. It's just a matter of scale,"" she says. And though Pinteric doesn't live on the property — she just rents the garage — Joys has cultivated a homey feel that has a lot to do with its location. Because the gallery opens onto the alley, many of Joys's regulars are the families next door. ""I'm watching kids grow up, and they come every year to the shows and they're a year older,"" she says. ""It's kind of special to have an organic, kind of neighbourly relationship with some of the visitors.""
As part of the 2023 edition of Gallery Weekend Toronto, Joys hosted a talk with artist Alyssa Alikpala. Here, visitors gather in the lane outside the exhibition space. (Ryley Remedios/AGAC Canada)
A live/work space like no other
Toronto artists Lisa Neighbour and Carlo Cesta are cultivating their own block-party vibe at Beauty Supply , a 170-square-foot space on the second floor of the couple's Geary Avenue house. Neighbour and Cesta are established artists who've both exhibited widely, and they describe themselves as ""pioneers on Geary."" It's been roughly 30 years since they moved into their home, which long pre-dates the bars and restaurants that have popularized the strip.
""Carlo and I both have been involved in kind of ad hoc galleries since we were in art school,"" says Neighbour, but it wasn't until 2018 when they rechristened Cesto's studio upstairs as Beauty Supply, opening to the public with a show by their friend Lee Goreas . Programming is sporadic, with new exhibitions held once or twice a year; a Kathleen Hearn exhibition is on the books for later this spring, they say, and visitor info will be available through the gallery's Instagram .

According to Neighbour, the original vision was an excuse to get the community together — to share some snacks and have a party — while creating more exhibition opportunities for locals. ""For us, it doesn't really cost that much extra money to have turned [the upstairs] into a gallery space,"" says Neighbour. The only downside, they say half-jokingly, is the pressure to clean up before visitors appear. ""Plus, it's a little bit selfish, but we get to actually experience the artworks in the gallery every single day of the exhibition,"" says Neighbour. ""It's wonderful.""
Creating the art world they want in condos, barns and backyards
As someone who shares the same rare privilege, Bonny Poon knows the feeling. Poon is an art dealer and the founder of Conditions , a commercial gallery she runs from a ground-floor condo near OCAD University in downtown Toronto. The unit currently boasts two rooms for exhibiting art: a high-ceilinged kitchen plus a bathroom/project space that's been cheekily rebranded as the ""Potty."" The gallery's entrance, which is a sliding patio door, immediately reveals the site's residential secret identity. Poon lives in the condo with her family in addition to running a second business out of the space, a fitness studio called Flow — though the room's white-cube austerity may suggest otherwise.
Before opening her Toronto gallery, which held its first on-site exhibition in the spring of 2024, Poon operated Conditions from a different domicile: a one-room apartment in Paris, which Artsy dubbed one of the "" most important young galleries in the world "" in 2019. Out in France, the work-from-home arrangement suited Poon just fine, she says, so she replicated the model upon returning to Canada. Living at the gallery spares Poon from an arduous commute and saves on rent to boot. Freedom, it seems, is the arrangement's greatest reward — and she especially enjoys having the ability to offer genuine hospitality. ""I can easily make guests dinner or a cup of tea in the kitchen,"" says Poon. ""There's definitely a sense of having more agency or feeling like this is on my terms. My conditions.""

The same ""make it happen"" philosophy applies at DIY spaces like Orchid Contemporary in Hamilton, a garage gallery founded in 2022 by artist and curator Adrien Crossman . ""If you can run a space, then it's one of the ways to create the art world you want without asking permission,"" says Crossman, whose programming at Orchid prioritizes underrepresented practices and work by artists from marginalized communities, including queer, trans and racialized folks.
Katie Lyle and Stefan Harhay, co-founders of Project Underwing in Toronto, have been throwing art exhibitions in their backyard since 2017. Inspired by the can-do spirit of artist-run spaces, they give participants free range to create what they wish. And at 13 Cedars , a brand new project space in Rowley, N.B., artist Jay Isaac has refurbished a small barn on his home property in a bid to grow the local contemporary-art scene. ""Coming from Toronto, one of the few things I miss is accessibility to contemporary art, so I decided the best thing to do is start a space,"" he tells CBC Arts over email.
A gallery where you'll find more chickens than people
Between Pheasants Contemporary in Kerns Township, Ont. (Between Pheasants Contemporary)
Meanwhile, in rural northeastern Ontario, Alexander Rondeau is also creating the change he wants to see. In 2021, while studying remotely, Rondeau began mounting exhibitions from a plywood shed on his mom and dad's farm in Kerns Township, Ont. The structure itself was built for pheasants and chickens, and it remains a working coop. ""I don't want to be corny, but I didn't want to, like, gentrify it,"" jokes Rondeau, and to his surprise, most artists have been comfortable — excited, even — to share space with livestock at Rondeau's Between Pheasants Contemporary . There's only been one bird-related snafu over the course of 20 exhibitions. A series of unframed prints proved too tempting for the pheasants, Rondeau explains. ""They made little nests.""
Between Pheasants Contemporary champions under-programmed artists, and many of the shows give priority to 2SLGBTQ+ perspectives. It's brought more contemporary art and dialogue to the region, says Rondeau, and he runs Between Pheasants in tandem with another project, Covey Bouquet , which offers support to curators interested in producing their own exhibitions in whatever ""sites of possibility"" they can find. Covey Bouquet's first exhibition , which was curated by Rondeau, was held in a horse barn and featured ""rural gothic"" works by Ontario artists Colin W Davis (North Bay) and Dunstan Topp (Sudbury).
There are, however, some obvious drawbacks to mounting an exhibition in the countryside. Foot traffic, for one thing, is non-existent. If 20 folks come out to a show, that's a ""huge success,"" says Rondeau. But on top of the in-person relationships he's built with engaged local art-lovers, he's found an even larger audience online .
For gallerists and patrons alike, there's no place like home
It's the same for La Shed , a gallery in Gabarus, N.S., a Cape Breton fishing village with fewer than 100 residents. In late 2019, Montreal gallerists André Laroche and Louis Joncas bought a seaside home in the community — auspicious timing, to be sure. When the pandemic struck, they fled Montreal. ""We just thought, 'Let's go for a couple weeks to Cape Breton,'"" says Laroche. ""That two weeks ended up being six months."" And as for La Shed — which is, in form, a spruced up tool shed with an ocean view — it's hosted exhibitions every year since then. This summer, it will have a group show devoted to emerging artists from Halifax, curated by Bijan Ramezani.
In 2023, Laroche and Joncas's eponymous gallery moved out of the Belgo Building and into their Montreal residence. That venture (The Apartment) has since closed, and Laroche, 65, plans to turn more of his attention to La Shed in Gabarus. Laroche, a self-described ""people person,"" loved the experience of running exhibitions from his home in the city. ""Sometimes people would stay maybe half an hour, sometimes an hour. Just the environment creates a different dynamic."" He greets significantly fewer guests at La Shed, given its remote location. Still, the attraction manages to draw the occasional ""adventurous visitor,"" he says.
It might feel odd to poke around a stranger's tool shed — or condo or chicken coop. But seeking contemporary art in unusual locations has its rewards. ""It might seem really kind of coveted or secret or, you know, insider-only,"" says Pinteric. ""But it's actually the opposite, in my experience.""
Storus feels the same. ""Institutions, they are very intimidating,"" she says. ""I think there's very few people I know who are outside of the arts that feel comfortable entering and accessing those spaces, and so I wanted to completely eliminate that barrier, you know, which is why I kind of prefaced [Garden Variety] as a community barbecue, but art."" And she has high hopes for Garden Variety's comeback season. ""My hope is that as many people as possible, from as many communities as possible, hear about this and come out.""",0.9999,positive
art,"Typographic Portrait of Jean Sibelius Composed Entirely of Brass Rule
In the dimly lit “printing cellar” of Media Museum and Archives Merkki is a remarkable and curious object. It’s a mosaic of tightly arranged brass rule and spacing material, made by a Finnish typographer Valto Malmiola in 1937. Note, it’s not a single piece of metal, and it’s neither engraved nor etched… it’s thousands of individual metal bits, pieced together by hand, and locked tightly into a frame for printing.
Figure 1. Forme for the Jean Sibelius print at the Media Museum and Archives Merkki.
When inked and pressed onto paper, it creates an image of the famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.
Figure 2. Portrait of Jean Sibelius, composed entirely of brass rule.
But, to me at least, the resulting image itself is not what’s interesting here. After all, it’s a fairly conventional portrait of Sibelius. What’s interesting and what makes the whole thing remarkable is how it’s made and how it came to be. It’s essentially a form of proto-ASCII art: intentionally (mis)using techniques and materials originally intended for printing text to create a complex image. What led to its creation? What is it anyway? Where did Malmiola get the idea to use letterpress in such an unconventional way?
The Use of Rules
Malmiola writes about the inspiration for the picture in the Finnish printing arts periodical Kirjapainotaito:
“When our renowned master composer Jean Sibelius turned 70 in 1935, [...] I was struck with a strange dream of trying to replicate his image using impractical typographic methods. I had previously seen pictures ""set"" with Monotype fonts and decorations in foreign graphic design trade journals, particularly ""The Inland Printer"", so I decided to try, but not with type and ornament, but with rule.
To give a bit of context, in letterpress printing, rules are strips of metal, often brass or type-cast metal, used for printing lines. They’ve been an integral part of printing since the early 1500’s.
Figure 3. Varying rule styles and thicknesses.
Rules are typically used for decoration, as a border around the edges of pages, or for creating simple designs on book covers or brochures. A variety of tones from light grey to solid black can be made by combining rules of different widths. Rules also have a functional use as dividers for adding structure and visual hierarchy in tables, catalogues, and other layouts.
Figure 4. A common use for brass rule. This is very familiar to us even today: think of spreadsheets.
Instead of using brass rules conventionally, Malmiola used them like building blocks. By carefully arranging rules of varying thicknesses in horizontal and vertical lines, he managed to make complex images.
Figure 5a. Closeup of the forme shows the individual elements and their positioning.
Figure 5b. Closeup of the print shows how the picture is formed after printing.
For those unfamiliar with letterpress techniques, or those who have never attempted to do a complex arrangement, the sheer insanity of Malmiola’s task might not be obvious.
Each element is carefully chosen or cut neatly into precise lengths and arranged in a way that leaves no air-gaps. Even the smallest unfilled space could lead to an unstable structure and make the whole thing unprintable. The level of precision, patience and skill needed to do what Malmiola did should should not be understated. How was it made?
The Construction of the Print
To plan the construction, Malmiola experimented with several approaches. He writes that the first attempt was a pitiful failure. The second attempt fared better. He came up with a “coding” system to classify different types of lines and spaces according to tonal values, by measuring the lights and shadows of the reference image, and marked each line with the resulting string of code. But he found the process too laborious and abandoned the idea. He also experimented with a “square system”, but doesn’t elaborate what he meant by that. My guess is that he tried using grid paper to map tonal values.
Unfortunately Malmiola doesn’t reveal his final method, but Paavo Haavi, who worked with Malmiola at K. K. Printing, says he used a one-to-one photographic enlargement of the reference image to help in the typesetting process . The reference Malmiola likely used is a photo of Jean Sibelius that appeared on the cover of Suomen Kuvalehti -magazine in 1925.
Figure 7. Cover of Suomen Kuvalehti -magazine which Malmiola used as a reference.
What’s clear, just by observing the image, is that Malmiola used what’s essentially a manual half-toning process by plotting the reference image into tonal values, which he then painstakingly constructed with brass rule, piece by piece. This kind of half-toning process is typically done by a photographic screen or some automated system, but Malmiola had to do it by hand. Where the reference image required a black area, Malmiola used a thick rule stacked tightly next to each other, and where a gray tone was required, he alternated between fine rules and spacers, creating illusions of various gray tones.
Figure 6. Closeup of the face shows how the various tones are constructed
The final print measures just 28 × 37,5 cm (~11"" × 14.7"" in.) but is crafted using a staggering 30 000 ciceros of brass rule (which equals to around 135 meters or ~442 feet) in addition to some spacers and quadrants for the white space.
Haavi also recounts that Malmiola presented the print to Sibelius in person, who reportedly exclaimed, “Tehän se vasta taiteilija olette!” , translating roughly to “Whose the true artist here!” Whether this was sincere or said tongue-in-cheek is not clear, but Sibelius signed the picture anyway and gave permission to include it in the prints, suggesting at least some level of validation and recognition for Malmiola.
Malmiola announced the finished piece in Kirjapainotaito and sold the prints for 10 mk (equivalent to about 4 € today, adjusted for inflation). Given the relatively small size of the Finnish typography scene at the time, there weren’t many who would actually appreciate such a print. The potential for profit was likely quite limited, so as an incentive, Malmiola sold the prints “for the benefit of war orphans” . But despite his efforts, Malmiola had difficulties in selling his prints. As Haavi notes, he had to resort to selling them on the streets of Helsinki and through newspaper ads for years after the print was made.
After Malmiola’s death, the original letterpress forme of the Sibelius-print was donated to the hand typesetters guild, and later on to the printing industry workers’ trade division, the Helsinki Print Workers’ Association (HKY). HKY sold prints of it, and used the profits to “enhance the professional skills of young people working in printing”. In 2015, HKY loaned the Sibelius forme to the Media museum and archive Merkki’s printing cellar, where it remains on public display.
Malmiola’s Other Prints
In addition to the Sibelius-print, Malmiola made at least four others.
1. Bullfinches pecking at rowan tree berries, print on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in 1938
In 1938, Malmiola created a print featuring bullfinches pecking at rowan tree berries for the 30th anniversary cover of the Kirjapainotaito magazine. Malmiola explained that the tree represents “the tree of professional knowledge”, while the birds symbolize the friends and readers associated with the Kirjapainotaito magazine.
Figure 8. Cover of Kirjapainotaito for February 1938
He writes about the making of it as follows:
“In this context, we dare to say a few words about the construction of this issue’s cover. Firstly, such a practice should not be pursued by anyone, but since people in the world have so many hobbies… The rowan berries are monotype ornaments the size of cicero em, turned upside down and vaguely shaped with a file to intentionally create a ragged feel. In nature, the birds’ backs are blue-gray, but by using semi-bold lines, the illusion of a third color is evident. […] The slightly incorrect alignment of colors is intentional and enhances the image’s ‘atmospheric content,’ and poor printing, if one generally knows how to print poorly, gives the picture a piquant effect. It remains for the reader to make the final judgment on the validity of the moods elicited by the ‘image’.
While the Sibelius print is quite dull in its precise imitation of the reference image, this artwork manages to take advantage of the unique properties of the technique. The inherent limitations in the material qualities of letterpress and brass rule, which result in sharp and square angles, gives the print almost a digital, or pixelated, look. What was, at the time, probably thought of as clumsy and naive, seems almost strikingly contemporary now. There is a nice balance between the rigid mechanical precision of typographic forms and the organic natural forms of the tree and birds, giving it a certain charm that’s missing in the Sibelius-print.
According to Haavi, the forme for this print was disassembled after printing to release the material back into use.
Figure 9. An original print can be found at the offices of Helsingin Kirjatyöntekijäin Yhdistys ry.
2. Lighthouse, print on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in 1939
In 1939, Malmiola’s pictorial typography had become well known among the readers of Kirjapainotaito.
Figure 10. Cover of Kirjapainotaito for November 1939
This print is a lot simpler than the previous ones he made, because Malmiola used a Monotype machine to make it, instead of composing the image with pre-made brass rules, like he had done earlier with the Sibelius-print. The Monotype machine also forced him to use only horizontal rules. The magazine includes a short description of the cover:
“The composer of the structure explains that the image was derived from the theme ‘the waves of time strike harshly.’ The line material used is from monotype casting, which explains why the image surface could be modified by even breaking the material, something that, of course, would not be acceptable or even permissible with ordinary lines.
He programmed the machine to cast custom-sized rules from type metal (= an alloy comprising lead, antimony, and tin). Unlike brass, type metal was bulk material and reusable. This meant that any errors could be corrected by melting the metal down for reuse, which made it a more cost-effective option than the expensive brass. The process, however, still demanded a lof of manual effort in hand-setting type and trimming the rules to the exact lengths needed to construct the image.
3. Carradale-print, 1942
In 1942 Malmiola finished another piece to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Finnish printing art.
Figure 11. Carradale, composed with 325 meters of Monotype rule
As far as I know, this is Malmiola’s largest print, measuring 45 × 53 cm (~18"" × 21"" in.) and uses an astonishing 72 000 ciceros of rule (around 325 meters or ~1 065 feet). Even though it was also made with a Monotype machine, and uses only horizontal rule, it took Malmiola 140 hours to complete.
Figure 13. Close-up of the print Figure 14. Close-up of the print
Even though Monotype machines make it possible to reuse the material, Malmiola’s wanted to preserve the layout, rather than melting it down. The type metal needed for the construction of the print was provided by the Valtioneuvoston kirjapaino (Government Printing Office), and not by Malmiola’s own employer, K. K. Printing, who probably lacked the required material (or the will to give it). Yet, according to Haavi, the forme was melted anyhow, after an apprentice dropped it on the floor.
Figure 12. The original photograph
The print is based on a photo by Allan C. Green of a four-masted steel barque named Carradale (which Malmiola incorrectly called a frigate), built in 1889. In 1914 the ship was sold to Finnish shipowner J. Tengström, and the photo appeared in various magazines at that time (see for example 1922 Nuori Voima № 48).
4. Forest-print, 1943
I don’t know much about the creation of this print, but I saw it for the first time when I visited the offices of Helsingin Kirjatyöntekijäin Yhdistys ry in Helsinki. This print also uses only horizontal rules, but the construction is much less precise than any of the others, resulting in some charming raggedness, which works well with the gloomy moon-lit forest scene.
Figure 15. This print by Malmiola is displayed at the offices of Helsingin Kirjatyöntekijäin Yhdistys ry
Malmiola’s Inspiration for the Technique
Many Finnish typographers followed and read foreign typographic journals, which inspired new ideas and techniques. In the late 1920’s, pictorial typography had emerged as a new trend in Germany. This method of producing images became a trendy topic in typographic trade journals. For example, Arthur Grams’ article “Das Buchdrucker als Architekt” (“The Printer as an Architect”) in Typographische Mitteilungen in July 1929 writes about pictorial typography in a way that explains its potential in typesetting:
“Most colleagues are simply unaware of the wealth of forms, particularly elementary forms, concealed within the typesetting case. Yet, it is in these elementary forms that the full and grand allure of picture composition truly emerges; the elementary forms render it an expressive medium for the new demands of the era. They may occasionally appear somewhat grotesque; however, this should not discourage one from exploring their subtleties. We must endeavor to continuously uncover new facets in picture composition, because the elements it comprises are our elements: type! Type belongs to the printer! That is the essence and purpose of picture composition; it is from this perspective that one must consider the matter.
Figure 16. A 1923 German typographic trade journal showcasing the new Silhouette type ornament series by Ludwig Wagner Type Foundry. It was used primarily for pictorial typesetting.
This new style spread from Germany, and inspired typographers like Valto Malmiola. Malmiola experimented with this style as early as 1933, and advocated for its use in an article titled “Yritys ‘kujeilla’ asiallisesti” (“An Attempt to do ‘Trickery’ Earnestly”) in Kirjapainotaito for December 1933 . He agreed with the idea that typographic elements are not just laying out text, but could be used for artistic expression. This early experiment probably inspired Malmiola to attempt a more ambitious project later on, leading to the creation of the Sibelius-print.
Figure 17. Malmiola’s early experimentations in pictorial typesetting.
In 1937, when Malmiola wrote about the creation of the Sibelius-print in Kirjapainotaito, he mentioned having seen pictures typeset with Monotype fonts and decorations in The Inland Printer. There are not many pictures set with Monotype in The Inland Printer that would match the year 1934 or 1935, but I found this portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, composed of 17 000 monotype characters in the May 1935 edition:
Figure 18. Franklin D. Roosevelt, composed of 17 000 monotype characters in The Inland Printer for May, 1935
This image is not created with brass rule, but with dots and colons. The gray tones are not achieved by purely half-toning optical illusion, but by having a tinted background (originally green) in the shape of the head .
While this image matches Malmiola’s description, I suspect his actual inspiration might have been something else. In January 1936, Graafikko, another Finnish trade journal, featured work by a Viennese printer, Carl Fasol. Fasol had developed a method of printing which he called “Stigmatype” already as early as 1860. Some of the stigmatype prints resemble the style and method of construction of Malmiola’s prints. Fasol introduced his invention to the public in 1867 with typeset picture of flowers and a picture of Gutenberg. Both images were reveled and he gained recognition especially among typographers. Fasol turned this into a series of Album for Printing Art, and traveled around Europe selling them, including Finland. .
Figure 19. Carl Fasol’s print of Johannes Gutenber’s house, made almost 70 years before Malmiola’s Sibelius print.
As a side note: the article also mentions some of Fasol’s prints were donated to Suomen Kirjapainomuseo (Finnish Printing Press Museum), which never actually existed, but the material is currently in the archives of Tekniikan Museo (The Museum of Technology). I went to look for the prints, but sadly couldn’t find them.
Beyond Fasol, there are many other typographers who used rules and other type elements to create pictorial typography in various delightful ways. Just to name a few, there’s Georg Wolffger in 1670, Monpied and Moulinet in ~1840’s and a whole trend of bending and twisting rules into all kinds of shapes in the 1870 – 1890’s. A comprehensive exploration of this phenomena would be required to put Malmiola’s work into proper context, but falls outside the scope of this post.
What’s interesting, is that these early practitioners of pictorial typography had recognized the potential of using small, modular, pixel-like elements to construct images. It laid the groundwork for how we understand and manipulate images today by showing how complex images can be made from simple, repeating parts. These early techniques were the building blocks for modern digital imaging, influencing everything from 4-color offset printing to bitmap graphics.

But... Why?
Pictorial typesetting was not always met with enthusiasm. It was often dismissed as a gimmick or childish dabbling, not just by traditionalists, but also by the rising avantgarde of typography. Jan Tschichold’s hugely influential book The New Typography, published in 1928, strictly forbade the use of any decorative elements or pictorial compositions made with type elements.
“The New Typography has absolutely nothing to do with ‘pictorial’ typesetting (Bildsatz) which has become fashionable recently. In almost all its examples it is the opposite of what we are aiming for.
— Jan Tschichold in The New Typography
Traditionalists, on the other hand, wanted typography to follow the established norms and styles of classical printing. In Finland, V. A. Vuorinen, a member of the Kirjapainotaito editorial team wrote an article in April 1934 titled “Latomisvälinen kuvittamisesta” (“Illustrating with typesetting tools”). In it, he stated that since typesetters usually lack formal artistic training, they should stick to what they know: simple typographic layouts.
“Finally, it should be mentioned that, in my opinion, a cobbler should stick to his last. Illustration is such a demanding task that not everyone is capable of it. At least I have come to the conviction that if a typesetter uses all his means and strength to produce good, proper typography, the value and artistry of the work becomes many times better than just dreaming of images. […] Let pictorial typesetting be seen as a pastime that can be indulged in between more important tasks, but when it’s necessary to produce something quickly, let’s work with letters and proper arrangements if there are no ready-made picture plates available, and most often leave the doomed-to-fail typesetting with illustrative means to the side.
Both the avantgarde and traditionalists viewed typographic experimentation, like what Malmiola was doing, as ridiculous and detracting from the primary purpose of typography: clear communication.
Vuorio’s article might have been written as an indirect response to Malmiola’s “Yritys ‘kujeilla‘ asiallisesti” (“An Attempt to do ‘Trickery‘ Earnestly”) in Kirjapainotaito for December 1933 . In it, Malmiola suggests that the method of creating pictorial typography should be taken seriously. But even then, Malmiola often downplayed his art, referring to his practice as merely a “hobby”. Did he do so to shield himself, and his work, from being too harshly judged as unprofessional by his colleagues?
Malmiola wrote that this kind of work “ought to be executed using straightforward methods; the design should be presented with just a few outlines, and importantly, there needs to be a hint of humor, as too serious an attempt might end up being inadvertently comical.” These thoughts seem somewhat unexpected, especially when contrasted with Malmiola’s solemn portrayal of Sibelius. Maybe Malmiola wanted to prove that his method had real potential for serious and respectful artistic expression by choosing Sibelius as his subject. Maybe he wished that by making a portrait of the renowned composer Jean Sibelius on his 70th birthday would make the technique seem more professional than how it was percieved by others.
Whatever the case may be, Malmiola’s dedication appears to have been driven more by passion, curiosity, and enjoyment rather than by financial or other superficial motives. As noted by Haavi, at that time, many typesetters, including Malmiola, took great pride in their profession and were interested in the discourse happening on an international level . Malmiola was a frequent contributor to Kirjapainotaito, writing short articles and essays, especially about pictorial typesetting. In April 1933 Malmiola wrote an article titled “Mielikuvitus latojan apuna” (“Imagination as an Aid to a Typesetter’s Skills”) where he argued that typesetting, while not a traditional art, requires imagination and creativity to produce exceptional work, and most importantly, to find joy in the work . This seems to have been the case for Malmiola, as he worked on his “hobby” during his free time and quieter work periods.
However, I get a sense that he wanted to share his art with a wider audience to show that letterpress was capable of producing actual art, and to contribute to the field he was passionate about. The Sibelius-print was showcased at the 1938 International Handicraft Exhibition in Berlin , and was featured in the Printing Art Quarterly -magazine , alongside the works of A. M. Cassandre, J. C. Leyendecker and László Moholy-Nagy.
Malmiola’s art would not have come to be without the support of his foreman Atte Syvänne, the technical director of the K. K. Printing, and member of Kirjapainotaito editorial staff. Under his leadership, the K. K. Printing had evolved into a well known general printing house in Finland. Syvänne was known for encouraging his employees, and it’s apparent, that in his role as Malmiola’s supervisor (or as the overseer of Malmiola’s own supervisors), he actively supported Malmiola’s interest in pictorial typesetting.
It’s also worth noting that not many foremen in the printing industry would have allowed the use of valuable resources, such as 30 000 ciceros worth of brass rule, for personal “hobby” projects. But Syvänne shared a passion for the art of printing with Malmiola, and permitted him to use resources for his experiments.
Syvänne also dabbled in pictorial typography himself, and one of his experiments appear on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in June 1936, a year before Malmiola’s Sibelius-print. This might have influenced and inspired Malmiola in his own typographic experiments.

Valto Malmiola’s Short Biography
As a morbid contrast to the playfulness of his work, I found out that he was a supporter for Nazi ideology after reading his article “Työn aateluus”. This, of course, casts a shadow on his legacy and I debated for a long time if I should even write about him. But, because I already sunk a lot of time into this research, and because his art is unique in the context of (Finnish) typography, and because his work is part of a bigger typographic phenomena, I decided to go ahead anyway. While his work is fascinating, it’s important to view his person with a critical understanding of this context. That said, fuck nazis and fuck Malmiola, may he rot in hell.

art,"Animation is justifiably praised as one of our most significant art forms. Talented writers infuse life into worlds of their own creation, reflecting our own, while artists capture the beauty and imperfections of our lives. If there were ever a time to commend a show for balancing comedy, anxiety, and artistry, it would be Adult Swim’s surreal animated series about a magic mushroom disrupting Big Pharma.
Common Side Effects, by co-creators Joe Bennett (Scavengers Reign) and Steve Hely (Veep, The Office, 30 Rock), asks a fleeting, shower-thought sort of question with sincerity: what if the world discovered a drug that could cure anything? Similar to a modern-day Prometheus, an animal-loving hippie named Marshall (Dave King) discovers blue mushrooms that have the ability to heal all physical injuries and ailments, including bullet wounds and dementia. For obvious reasons, pharmaceutical companies don’t want his discovery to go public, so they falsify records and frame him as a wanted criminal.
This leads him to confide in his former high school lab mate, Frances (Emily Pendergast). Unbeknownst to him, Frances works as the assistant to the head of Reutical Pharmaceuticals, whose inept CEO Rick (Mike Judge)’s job is riding on a new commercial drug. What follows is an intense and suspenseful cat-and-mouse manhunt where Marshall and Frances duck DEA agents, hitmen, and desperate everyday people for their life-changing drug whose mysterious side effects might not be worth the trouble in the long run.
What makes Common Side Effects a unique animated series is the earnestness of its themes, despite being such a weird-looking show. At one moment, it’s a dark espionage drama filled with political betrayals, undercover agents, and gruesome deaths. In the next, it’s a lively comedy where DEA agents groove to Harry Belafonte’s “Jump in the Line” and little alien dudes cartwheel with their booties out, all while its entire exhausted cast looks like walking bobbleheads. The show’s eerie-meets-zany tones should clash, but Common Side Effects finds harmony by balancing its spinning plates without losing focus on that burning question about what a miracle drug would do to the world.
At its core, Common Side Effects is a show that transcends conventional critiques of the United States healthcare system. Instead of relying on a simplistic premise where the heroes triumph over the evil corporation and spread the wealth, the show delves into a more nuanced and compelling narrative about how hope turns to despair. With each episode, Common Side Effects explores how the gravity of deciding what to do with a universal cure-all drug capable of eliminating copays, premiums, and debt-laden obstacles would wear down anyone trying to capitalize on it. Both the show’s protagonists and its scheming antagonists find themselves overwhelmed as they grapple with the immense responsibility that comes with holding the fate of the world in their hands.
Like Scavengers Reign, Common Side Effects is abound with lush and vivid background art; surreal, kaleidoscopic, fluid animation; and shocking violence—all working in concert with its suspenseful narrative. All of the above coalesces in a gut-wrenching finale that, thankfully, escapes its predecessor’s fate, leaving the possibilities of what lies in store for season two to cut even deeper into its gripping tale.

art,"Playing music—or attempting to, at least—isn’t the only way zoo animals can express themselves. They’ve been known to dabble in the visual arts as well. Zoos across the country have provided their animals with canvases and paintbrushes to make art. Luckily, we have footage of the animal artists at New York’s Rosamond Gifford Zoo pawing and pecking away at their works in progress.
The above YouTube video from Insider stars a diverse array of animals in the artistic zone. While Basil the red panda simply grabs the brush to create his masterpiece, the zookeepers must get creative helping animals who don’t have paws. For example, workers hand Briggs, the African Guinea hog, a brush with a wide, flat end so that he can grab it with his teeth. Meanwhile, Jeckyl, the African pied crow, pecks at a brush stuffed into a swinging rope toy to express his artistic side.
The Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse isn’t the only place where this happens. The video shows other facilities—from California’s Oakland Zoo to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado—bringing out their animals’ inner Picassos. In some cases, animals at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo learn art as part of training exercises. They step into nontoxic paints and walk over a canvas in the direction of a target, and once they reach it they receive a treat. No animals are forced to participate in the activity.
According to the Insider video, many zoos auction off animal paintings, and the earnings are typically donated to animal welfare facilities or designated for in-house animal care. The Rosamond Gifford Zoo has even dedicated an annual auction event to animal art called Art Gone Wild.
Encouraging these animals to paint isn’t just for our amusement; the activity is part of enrichment training. The Saint Louis Zoo defines enrichment as a process that stimulates animals and encourages them to be more active. Other forms of enrichment include adding different scents to an environment, providing puzzle feeders, and giving animals various toys. Such activities can be beneficial. A 2011 study from the Journal of Animal Science suggested that environmental enrichment can reduce actions related to high stress levels in zoo animals.

At the Whitney Museum of American Art, celebrated painter Amy Sherald is unveiling American Sublime, marking her first New York museum solo show. In a suite of nearly 50 paintings, including her powerful portraits of Michelle Obama and Breonna Taylor, the exhibition traces her journey from 2007 into today in lyrical compositions, centering the beauty and depth of Black life in America.
Sherald paints with a steady, loving hand. Taking technical cues from the American Realist tradition – a movement which originated in the halls of HBCUs – she captures the faces of those left out of the art historical narrative, each opulent in their ordinariness and radiant individuality.
“Sherald’s contemplative subjects appear most concerned with their own interiority, prioritizing their own peace and self-realization over how others might perceive them and the shackles of history, though they are inevitably impacted by both,” the museum wrote in a recent statement. “Her audacious project highlights what she has called the ‘wonder of what it is to be a Black American,’ rendering a rich and unconstrained Black world in vibrant Technicolor.”
Alongside the gallery presentations, Sherald presents “Four Ways of Being,” a newly commissioned work displayed on the facade of the Horatio Street building facing the museum. “American Sublime is a salve,” the artist expressed. “A call to remember our shared humanity and an insistence on being seen.”

art,"Tattoos. Body paint. Henna. All these are popular kinds of body art with varying histories and cultural connotations, many going back centuries or even longer. They all have something in common, though—they all change how the body reflects light back to the viewer. What if, instead, body art could shine a light of its very own?
This is the precise topic which [Katherine Connell] came to discuss at the 2024 Hackaday Supercon. Her talk concerns rethinking body art with the use of light emitting diodes—and is both thoroughly modern and aesthetically compelling. Beyond that, it’s an engineering development story with liquid metal and cutting-edge batteries that you simply don’t want to miss!
In her quest to create self-glowing body art, [Katherine] invented Sprite Lights. In her own words, “these body safe light up temporary tattoos combine art, flex PCBs, screen printed batteries, and a body-safe adhesive tape.” Basically, you can place them on your skin, and they’ll shine and catch eyes for as long as there’s juice left in the sticker.
The inspiration behind this project was simple. [Katherine] grew up in the 80s, and being exposed to that neon-soaked era gave her a desire to glow-in-the-dark. However, she didn’t want to get into any hardcore body modification—hence, she pursued a non-invasive stick-on solution.
As you might imagine, creating these wasn’t trivial. They need to stick to the skin for long periods of time without causing irritation, while also being lightweight and slim enough to be practical to wear. Indeed, to that end, Sprite Lights are less than 1.5 mm thick—an impressive engineering feat.
Her first attempts involved creating a synthetic skin-like material using latex, with LEDs stuck underneath. However, this wasn’t a particularly desirable solution. Latex allergies are relatively common, and producing the designs took a lot of careful hand-soldering and manual work. It was also difficult to attach the latex to the skin, and to color match it with the wearer to make it look right.
From there, [Katherine] experimented with 3D-printing thin films with transparent PLA, with LEDs underneath. This was a much quicker way to work, but still didn’t attach well to the skin and had some aesthetic flaws. Another 3D-printing attempt saw [Katherine] create molds to produce transparent silicone films with LEDs embedded underneath, but this again proved very labor intensive and it’s difficult to get silicone to stick to anything, including humans. [Katherine] even tried experimenting with Galinstan, a very off-beat metallic alloy, to make circuits inside flexible silicone. She created viable stretchable circuits but they were not very robust, particularly since the Galinstan tends to melt at body temperature.
Later experiments with copper tape enabled [Katherine] to make flexible circuits a bit more easily. She used a Cricut to cut out traces in copper tape, and then stuck them on clear heat-resistant plastic. From there, she used a Walmart griddle to heat the assembly until solder paste liquified and her components were soldered in place. It required careful attention and speed to avoid melting everything, but it worked.
Having developed decent flexible circuits that could light up, power was next on the agenda. Desiring to create stick-on devices with an ultra-thin form factor, there was no room to include a traditional battery, so [Katherine] had to figure out how to power Sprite Lights effectively. She found flexible batteries from a company called Zinergy that could deliver 3V and 20 mAh. She was able to specify a custom flat round design, with the company able to make them just 0.7mm thick and 55 mm round. They use a compound similar to regular AA batteries, which is screen printed onto one layer of plastic and sealed with another layer on top. The batteries have the benefit of being safe to place on skin, with no risk of explosion or chemical exposure, even if they happen to be punctured or cut while worn. Perhaps the only drawback is that they’re non-rechargeable—they’re safe, but single-use.
Armed with her new batteries, [Katherine] developed her concept further. She stepped up to using commercially-available flex PCBs produced by JLCPCB, in place of her homebrewed concepts used previously. She combined these with the flexible Zinergy batteries underneath, and custom-made die-cut stickers from MakeStickers on top. This gave her an art layer, an LED circuit layer, and a battery layer underneath, with a hypoallergenic medical tape used as the final layer to stick the assembly to the skin. An intermediate fabric tape layer is included to connect the battery’s contacts to the flex PCB, which is populated with LEDs. By leaving a paper layer on the fabric tape between the contacts, this allows the Sprite Light to remain off until it’s ready to be used. The combination comes in under 1.5 mm thick.
[Katherine] went through a great deal of iteration and development to get Sprite Lights to where they are today. She notes that you can learn anything online if you put in the work and connect to the right communities—it was through self-directed research that she taught herself the skills to get the project over the line. Beyond that, it’s also worth noting that technology might not be quite up to what you need right now—her project relies heavily on brand-new custom Zinergy batteries to be as thin as possible. Her next challenge is mass production—something she has pursued via a crowd-funding campaign.
Ultimately, Sprite Lights are a super-cool piece of body art. But beyond that, [Katherine] told us the great engineering story behind these astounding self-glowing stickers. As her fine example demonstrates, you can do really cool things if you just keep working at it and teach yourself the right skills along the way!",0.9962,positive
art,"Corel’s latest version of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite sees the industry veteran squaring up to the dominance of Adobe Illustrator. It offers a top-quality vector drawing and layout app that bests Illustrator in some ways, though its photo editing isn’t as strong.
Why you can trust Creative Bloq Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.
It’s easy to think that Adobe is the only game in town when buying graphic design software and photo-editing software. It’s not true, though Photoshop and InDesign can be dominant in professional publishing. There are alternatives such as Affinity, open-source options such as GIMP, Inkscape and Scribus, and there is Corel, which has been around since 1989 but for some reason is calling itself Alludo these days.
The CorelDRAW Graphics Suite of 2025 retains the Corel name, however, and you’ll undoubtedly recognise the main apps: CorelDRAW and Corel Photo-Paint. Paintshop Pro, which Corel also owns, isn’t part of the suite, which is rounded out by the Capture screen capture utility, a font manager, and a load of fonts, photos, art and templates. It also allows you to use CorelDRAW Web, but not CorelDRAW Go.
Swipe to scroll horizontally Pricing OS Mac/Windows Free trial 15 days Subscription £26.58/month One-time purchase £659 (equiv to 24.8 months)
Setup and getting started
• Easy to install
• Lots of tutorials
Installing the suite is simple - you download an installer, and it does all the work. You end up (in Windows 11, anyway) with icons on your desktop for CorelDRAW, Photo-Paint, Capture, plus the font manager. CorelDRAW sounds like an Illustrator equivalent, and Photo-Paint sounds a bit like Photoshop, so if you’re wondering where the InDesign-like layout app is, that sort of thing is handled by CorelDRAW.
We launched CorelDRAW first, and were presented with a welcome page not dissimilar to those from Adobe and whoever owns Affinity these days (it’s Canva - Ed). This gives you the choice of opening a template or a blank page, of viewing the tutorials, including a useful one on the new features in 2025 to bring you up to speed if you’re a returning user, or going to the store to buy brushes, vector packs and bolt-on AI tools including one that generates vector art from text prompts.

Alongside the tutorials, CorelDRAW is well set up to guide new users through its functions, with a panel on the right by default showing tips and detailing what each tool does, down to the very basics.
If you’re an Adobe user, then the interface will look broadly familiar, and both CorelDRAW and Photo-Paint have workspaces you can switch to that ape Illustrator and Photoshop, respectively, even making the interface background darker. By default, there are tools on the left, which have the sorts of uses you’d expect, and colours and palettes (known as ‘dockers’) on the right, which you can pop in and out as you need them. These stay open until you close or minimise them, at which time the document window expands to fill the space, but the colours, which for a pillar the height of the screen, are always available. Instead of closing when you open a document, the welcome screen remains on the tab bar, so you can go back to it and browse at any time. It’s a neat system, and there's also a tablet mode so that it can be used more easily on touchscreen devices.

Features
• Pro-grade illustration
• Photo editing less focused
The CorelDRAW Graphics Suite is full of the types of features you’d expect from pro-grade graphic design software. So there's a range of curves, shapes (including a shape recognition tool that will transform sketches to vectors) and a spiral (‘Twirl’) tool with more options than Illustrator’s. Possibly best are the natural media brushes which lead to strokes over Beziers even if you paint them freehand. Being a vector app, you can change the brush style and colour after you’ve made the stroke. Elsewhere, blending, shadowing and transparency all get their own tools. If you’re looking to do page layout, the frames and text manipulation options are all here, with the ability to import raster images just as you’d expect.
Over in Photo-Paint, there are plenty of useful features. You can make a mosaic out of a folder full of photos with PhotoCocktail, there's a suite of cropping, perspective correction, straightening and image slicing tools. You get cloning, red-eye removal, and spot healing, while basic adjustments such as Levels and Hue and Saturation open in the right-hand sidebar so that they don’t float over your image in a separate window. Photo-Paint feels like a secondary app to CorelDRAW, with a smaller toolbar, and raw image processing appeared to be a weakness, with the Sony mirrorless files we tried appearing dark, soft and with an incorrect white balance compared with Adobe Camera Raw. There's enough here, though, to keep CorelDRAW fed with raster images, and the effects tools contain plenty of sharpening and noise reduction options.
What we don’t get is a great deal of AI. There are plugins for the graphics suite, such as VisionFX, VectorFX and AI HDR Studio (all of which you’ll have to buy separately) that offer AI tools, but they’re easy to ignore if you don’t want them. More interesting on the store was the Painterly brush pack, which was running at an 80% discount when we looked, and greatly expands the already full selection of natural media brushes available.
Features score: 3/5

User experience
• Broad import and export options
• Apps lack individuality
The default CorelDRAW and Photo-Paint interface is light in colour and stripped back, with all the deeper options hidden behind Dockers or fly-out menus accessed by holding down tool icons. We needed to check a couple of times which app we were actually using, as they appear so similar.
The Learn Docker is a fantastic feature that more apps should emulate, as it aids not just beginners but also seasoned professionals trying out something new or thinking about switching systems. Not everybody has three hours to sit through video tutorials, so having a sidebar that dynamically updates depending on which tool you have selected, and with written content you can absorb while working, is a really nice touch.
There's a degree of interoperability between Corel and Adobe. You can open Illustrator and Photoshop files in CorelDRAW and Photo-Paint, but InDesign users won't be able to port their files straight across - there's a workaround involving a press-quality PDF with embedded fonts, but you’ll need to experiment to see if this fits into your workflow. You can then export from CorelDRAW as an Illustrator file, a generic EPS, AutoCAD files, or any number of raster formats. One thing Adobe users may not appreciate when switching to Corel is that the pan tool isn’t attached to the spacebar but requires its own tool, with the H keyboard shortcut. This switches you away from your currently selected tool. The mouse wheel is bound to zooming rather than scrolling by default too, while auto-saves are off.
UX score: 4/5
(Image credit: Future)
Who's it for?
The CorelDRAW Graphics Suite is a relative bargain compared to Creative Cloud. Subscribing to Adobe apps individually is even more expensive, so you’d go for the All Apps plan, and get Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign (plus some other stuff, like Premiere Pro) for £56.98 a month after the discounted rate that applies for the first three months. CorelDRAW is £26.58 a month for CorelDRAW and Photo-Paint, or a one-off payment of £659. Alternatively, you can get the Affinity Suite of three apps (Designer, Photo and Publisher) for £159.99 and maybe use the free version of DaVinci Resolve for your video editing. Corel thus occupies an awkward middle ground between the market leader and the scrappy upstart, and you’ll need to make sure it has what you need before you jump in. For anyone who’s been using Corel for decades, though, it’s an easy upgrade.

art,"It remains an unprecedented time for The Pokémon Company as demand for Pokémon TCG products continues to outpace its production capabilities, despite printing nearly 12 billion cards between March 2023 and March 2024. New expansions for the Scarlet and Violet era have been arriving every few months, with the year starting by introducing the Eevee-themed Prismatic Evolutions set.
Now, it’s time for Journey Together to take center stage as the expansion — featuring beloved trainers paired with their iconic Pokémon — has just released.

Where did you grow up and how has this influenced your art? I grew up in Houston, Texas, which does boast some deep-welled art resources: it’s Contemporary Arts Museum, Museum of Fine Arts, the Rothko Chapel and the insane Menil Collection, which houses, I think, the largest collection of Rene Magritte’s artwork this side of the Atlantic. But the culture is anything but art, or at least it was in the '70s and '80s that I was there for. There was an underground group of people scattered around the city that weren’t as obsessive about football and church, but it took me until high school to really find it, so I was largely left alone to sort out my art life. My mum helped a little in supporting it with art classes here and there, but it wasn’t until she made me apply and then get into a high school for performing and visual arts that I felt like I found my people and a way out of Texas to the more artful New York City after graduation, and on from there.

What, outside of art, has most influenced you over the years? I think movies, TV and books dominated my art seeking back then. There really wasn’t much else to chase after given the culture in Houston, and the storytelling aspect of those mediums really shaped me hugely, and led me into comics and books, and now working in film and TV as an artist. I think in some ways the lack of support and community for an art life down there was a bit of a book for teaching me to stand on my own, and carve my own path as an artist; there simply was no other choice. Sometimes the negative is what defines the positive.
Is there a painting that you saw in your formative years that changed everything? What was it? Well I don’t know if it was just one painting. I recall having my hair blown back when the Menil hosted some Francis Bacon paintings. Pretty much lived at that place, just down the road from my high school, and would spend hours with the Magrittes. Ad Reinhardt was another revelation I found there, plus Alice Neel, Sue Coe and Joseph Beuys when I worked at the Contemporary Arts Museum too. Man I loved those exhibits and remember how much I loved being there alone with that work. It was poorly attended, which wasn’t great for the museum but was a gift to me personally. I had a very private and intense creative education in that way, steered by what caught me above all, and anything remotely narrative was especially grabbing.

Tell us about your first paid commission. Does it stand as a representation of your talent? I don’t have a distinctive memory of my first paying gig to be honest. I’m lacking the framed dollar bill memoriam of that moment to seal it into history. Likely I was just happy to get paid for work at all, as any of us are when we’re starting out. I expect it was after college when I was working as a home repair monkey in Brooklyn and drawing comics at night. I did my first graphic novel Sudden Gravity that way, but it doesn’t count as I wasn't paid a penny for that. Maybe it was The Matrix Comics back in the late '90s? I got brought in as a Johnny-on-the-spot when one of their slotted artists vanished on them, and I had to write, paint and letter a full eight-page story in about four days. I think that’s what really turned my corner in a lot of ways. It gave me a taste for the thrill of the deadline crunch and I ended up doing a lot of work for them after as a result, which I was paid for at last. It sort of began my career as the emergency deadline saviour, which I still employ as a method even after all these years.

What’s the last piece you finished, and how do the two differ? A lot of my work is under NDA right now so it’s a tricky one to answer. Let’s call it the trio of portraits HBO commissioned me to do for The Last of Us Season 2 campaign. The work is profoundly different to the art I was doing early on. While I did work a lot in black and white, I was pushing hard on the full-colour front just to expand my scope of work wherever possible. When you’re starting out you want to cast as wide a net as you can, and say yes to all the things that come in until you can grow a firmer grip on your steering wheel and direct your path more later. But the black and white work has remained a constant and an approach that I’ve championed ever since those first published pieces, and being in a position to codify that in a major global campaign in this way was a real moment for me personally. To have art that is seen by most as unfinished until it's coloured become the feature was an important flag to plant so others coming up, fellow weirdos trapped in non-artful upbringings, might see hope in this kind of thing. It felt especially significant.

Is making a living as an artist all you thought it would be? The landscape has changed dramatically since the 90s when I was coming up, for good and ill of course, but I think more for the better overall. The internet’s opened up a lot of new avenues to make a living, and connect with peers, clients and collectors that just wasn't available without the gatekeepers nod of approval before. And while I did largely focus on comics for the first 20 or so years, almost exclusively, I wasn’t really a superhero guy and neither was I really in line with the New York alternative comics scene that I was immersed in back then. If it wasn’t for the years of support of my manager Allen Spiegel, I don’t know what or how I would have done anything. He really taught me how to navigate it all, wrestle with contracts, handle crappy clients and deadlines, and the conflicts that come up in any kind of work you do. My ability to work solely as a creative artist and writer all these years is a credit to his guidance and support, and getting to be part of this crew alongside the giants that inspired me in the first place – DaveMcKean, Kent Williams, Jon J.Muth, George Pratt and so on – showed me a peek ahead of how to make it work.
What advice would you give to your younger self to aid you on the way? I think it would be the same ethic that Spiegel taught me as I was learning the ropes: always be willing to work harder and longer than the other person; never ever hack out a project – whatever job you agree to do, however small or low budget, always give it the same attention, passion and energy as you might bestow on some big opportunity or high profile job; and a job is about the work, a career is about people. Always follow people and not companies, and create and nurture relationships that are lasting and positive. Even if your gig is a crisis gig for reasons having nothing to do with you personally, to be able to holdfast and still stick the landing while remaining professional endears you to clients in ways you can never really quantify, but it makes or breaks careers alone. No one in this work I know who has a career now, even after all these years, got here from anything less than a stubborn, obsessive drive to never stop working. Hard work and relentless persistence outpaces raw talent in every way, always.

How has the art industry changed for the better since you began? I think there’s a lot more agency in the artist’s hands than there has ever been before. We don’t have to court relationships that we don't have yet as the sole means of gaining access to a career like you once did. It’s what made my Covid years twice as busy with work, what has allowed me to live, raise a family and work consistently while living in a rural town 30 minutes deep into the forests outside Northampton, Massachusetts. The advent of social media has been one of the most altering things to ever hit our field and I’m glad I was both young enough to grip it and old enough to temper it’s use as an artist, because it’s definitely a knife that can cut both ways. But knowing for a fact how hard it was to get in back when it was high walls and gatekeepers everywhere, I’m grateful for the opportunities and abilities it has provided. A lot of us, especially the troglodyte profiles inherent to making comics, have a hard time with the schmoozing and courting elite power brokers that used to be required to get in. Being in New York City, near all the publishers and art scene there, was essential in a way it isn’t any more. Now anyone with a connection can get spotted by an editor or art director from anywhere in the country. Just ask Jeff Kinney and a dozen or more other authors and creatives able to carve a path in our field thanks to this new technology.

What character or scene that you've painted do you most identify with? That’s weirdly tricky. I think as a rule I try to make sure to identify with any character I’ve worked on, whether it’s a music video for Prince, characters from a film I adore like Kim from Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, Naiches and Goyakhla from Indeh with Ethan Hawke, Conan the Barbarian for Dark Horsewith Kurt Busiek, or getting to work on Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. My own characters tend to be the ones I connect with the most personally; Walt from The Lost Boy especially, Jack and Cooper from Meadowlark, and in a lot of ways all three of my main characters in the novel I’m working on now. If you're doing it right there’s bits of your identity in each of the characters you work with, create or sculpt.

art,"Read Culture Fragile Intangibilities: Exploring Migration, Memory and Identity Through Art A solo exhibition by visual artist and resident, Daphne Arthur Afrodet Zuri Photo by Carlos Hernandez. Courtesy of Project for Empty Space
Newark’s Project for Empty Space (PES) launches its 2025 exhibition season with Fragile Intangibilities, a solo exhibition by visual artist and resident, Daphne Arthur. This exhibition showcases eleven translucent silk organza tents adorned with delicate ink drawings. Each structure encapsulates the complex stories of migration, resilience, and identity, presented through a poetic yet tangible lens.
The exhibition draws not only from Arthur’s personal experiences as a Venezuelan-born immigrant but also from conversations with fellow first-generation migrants and immigrants in New York and Connecticut. By weaving these narratives through hand-sewn silk canvases, Fragile Intangibilities creates mesmerizing spaces where viewers can explore themes of belonging, transformation, and the collective resonance of memory.

A Meditation on Memory and Migration
Arthur’s silk organza tents are more than artworks; they are vessels of memory and identity. When asked about how her personal experiences influenced the creation of the series, Arthur explained how her life has been molded by movement, people, and places. “Our life experiences, the people we encounter, and the places we navigate continuously shape our perception of the world,” she shared. This philosophy forms the conceptual foundation of her work.
Arthur’s artistic practice took a fascinating turn while teaching at Ashcan Studio Art, when one of her students gifted her Japanese horsehair brushes and Aobana ink. The ink’s ephemeral nature, disappearing on contact with water, spoke to Arthur’s primary medium of smoke, another fleeting material. “I first experimented with [Aobana] on paper, drawn to its fleeting nature,” she recounted. “However, when I began working on silk for the tents, I had to use more permanent inks, which interacted with the fabric differently.”
The use of silk as her primary material carries profound significance. Often associated with migration, trade, and cultural exchange, silk embodies both fragility and resilience. These qualities, Arthur explained, are an apt metaphor for the themes her work addresses. “The fabric’s visible tension without tearing mirrors the resilience found in displacement,” she noted, emphasizing how each tent symbolizes the enduring strength of memory and the stories we carry.
The collaborative making of the tents added further meaning. Arthur worked closely with her aunt to sew the structures, turning the project into a reflection on care, labor, and the often-overlooked contributions of marginalized communities. This labor-intensive process, imbued with love and history, underscores the importance of generational connections.

Stories Woven into Silk
The tents in Fragile Intangibilities act as canvases for collective storytelling, featuring imagery inspired by the interviews Arthur conducted. Each narrative compelled her to explore memory and symbolism as anchoring tools.
One deeply moving story came from Mikka, a Ugandan member of the Red Monkey clan, tasked with acting as a steward for the species. Mikka shared his experience of studying medicine in China, leading Arthur to integrate symbolic elements such as guardian lions and motifs inspired by Nyero rock paintings. These patterns suggest the cyclical and interconnected nature of his life’s transitions. “The spiral, recurring across cultures, speaks to overlapping stories and transformations,” Arthur explained. Mikka’s tent, suspended high in the exhibit, draws the viewer’s gaze upward, demanding contemplation of depth and layered meaning.
Another poignant narrative transported viewers to North Macedonia through the memories of Anastajia, who grew up in a post-war communist landscape. She vividly recalled wild plants reclaiming abandoned buildings and her formative years visiting her best friend’s sunlit apartment, where a pet turtle resided in a corner. These subtle yet powerful snapshots informed the delicate imagery that adorns Anastajia’s tent, blending themes of reclamation, rootedness, and personal history.
Through these stories, Arthur captured the resilience of memory in the face of displacement. “Beyond memory, I wanted this project to critically examine the intersections of race, gender, and labor,” she said, addressing systemic inequities and emphasizing the importance of acknowledging marginalized voices.

Identity and Belonging as Evolving Ideas
Arthur’s work challenges static notions of identity or belonging. “For me, home is not merely a place; it is a felt sense of rootedness, one that transcends geography, culture, and circumstance,” she said. She hopes her viewers will experience the exhibition as an invitation to question, rather than define, identity. “I want the work to invite contemplation, not conclusion—to open space for personal resonance and unexpected connections,” she explained.
The fragile, dreamlike nature of Arthur’s silk tents reflects the ways identity and memory shift over time. They stand as symbols of the stories individuals carry across geographies and generations, evolving as shaped by movement and encounter.

PES’s Vision for Art and Community
Jasmine Wahi and Rebecca Pauline Jampol, Co-Directors of Project for Empty Space, celebrated the alignment between Arthur’s exhibition and the organization’s mission to foster social equity and engagement. “Daphne is kicking off our 2025 exhibition season with a stunningly delicate body of work that she’s carefully crafted during her two years with us,” they shared.
The collaborative nature of Arthur’s process is at the core of PES’s community-focused vision. “Her artworks are deeply connected to collaborations with members of migrant and immigrant communities,” the directors added. The tents, they explained, act as “storytelling capsules,” creating intersectional safe spaces where shared experiences and histories come alive. By amplifying diverse voices, PES and Arthur aim to inspire a broader sense of belonging and connection.

AIart,my experience is that most real artists are overrated i should preface by mentioning that ive spent lots of money paying artists for illustrations and various other  for me so i can directly compare their work with the stuff  makes put simply unless you are literally top maybe even top most talented there is a overwhelming chance you are not worth it the people im currently working with are affordable in that they charge me bucks for character renderings and about bucks for individual imagesillustrations this is actually a fairly good deal there are artists charging hundreds of dollars per image but its also worth noting the team is from a developing country which is why they can charge this lower price yet even this socalled low price is still very high by any ordinary persons standard most people cannot afford to casually throw bucks on  every month which ive been doing for the past couple of years but now im beginning to wonder if ive been wasting my money its possible ill eventually end up replacing the old  with new updated  versions because the  simply produces better looking  the vast majority of the time i originally gravitated towards my current artists because of the combination of fairly high  affordability but half way through the project their best artists the one working on my stuff left and was replaced by another considerably less talented enough the new  isnt terrible but its a noticeable downgrade yet prices remain the same i will be honest pretty much the only reason im still paying for  is that  just isnt precise enough yet it can produce pretty images but you cannot control every detail within the scene nor can you replicate the same characters and images between different scenes an  will give you exactly what you describe which is what is currently keeping them relevant for now still more and more i find myself questioning why im paying dollars a month for  that is actually lower  in terms of fidelity and detail than what something like mj can do fairly easily ill cut to the chase and just say this outright the absolute very moment that the technology has advanced to a point where i can precisely control every element of a scene and have consistent characters will probably happen once d technology has been integrated i will go full  and never look back sorry real  but lack of consistency and control are literally the only thing currently keeping you relevant im not going to pay you dollars for a lower  image and your content is lower  of the time when an  can do it for me for virtually nothing and still produce superior end result,0.9555,positive

AIart,the problem with  images generation is labor not copyright i could go into the specifics of how  images are not  they arent but that is not what im here to talk about  whether it be creating a single piece or the cultivation of ones own  of work over the course of the years all requires labor it is a skill that takes effort to cultivate and maintain and before anyone says  learns like humans do no it does not humans cannot instantaneously train on millions of different works just by looking at them humans have their own subjective experiences tastes and perspectives two humans could draw a still life and youd get two completely different results with their own nuances and  is not capable of this its just meaningless remixing of information that being said when a robot is scraping someone work it is quite literally stealing that persons labor  does not need to be faster especially in this day and age the things that made  pieces so incredible back in the day was because artists were allowed the time to cultivate their skills as individuals and contribute to societyculture with said skills and instead we are deskilling and devaluing  for meaningless content and endless consumption as if there were not an endless supply of bad content already where  was sacrificed for the sake of growing profits you want a real  revolution stop with the  nonsense and advocate for a world where people can afford the time to develop their creative interests in a meaningful way creativity is despised by fascism and capitalism because it takes time and generally speaking safe conditions to be cultivated to its maximum potential and creativity creates emotional and critical thinkers  images do not do this a machine that has no idea who you are or what your life experiences never will the labor of artists was already not taken seriously or people think its just some innate gift that artists are born with rather than a labor that took years to foster people already did not like paying us because all of the work that artists do is relegated to credit scenes or the internet post that does not show the hours and years of work that it took to get there in short its unappreciated but for some reason the solution to a series of industries that work with artists is to remove them from the workforce by weaponizing their own labors against them and for what more services oversaturated with hastily made media,0.6791,positive

AIart,i think the real problem is the capitalist system  the reason is that if there wasnt such a fierce competition for resources people wouldnt be so defensive about personal property everything would be more open and relaxed capitalism is hostile by nature especially when its not regulated i also think that  wouldnt be used in such a sloppy manner for quick content if people werent striving for attention it could just be used for idea exploration and experimentation and people wouldnt be so divided on it it all comes back to money and how this system has enslaved humanity thats the real underlying issue,-0.2835,negative

AIart,labelling is how we move into the future we completely agree that  hate is rising among the general population we dont know exactly when this started but we think it even predates the massive  push weve all experienced over the past years artists know that being born gifted with natural artistic talent is only one small part of the equation of becoming an  by the time an  is wellknown and their  is being recognized the  has put in years and years of hard labor in obscurity developing their talent and their craft obviously none of us can ever know what makes a person turn bitterly hateful towards anyone but again we agree that especially in  circles there is a kind of joyful celebration in how easily it has suddenly become to steal artists work dilute the power of existing  and generally mock and disrespect the reality of the dedication and perseverance it takes to create  to begin with now all that to say weve recently created a new labelling tool this tool uses  to check the likelihood that an image was created by   and then it creates a shareable link with the results we believe this tool and tools like it are needed to begin bringing order back to society without being too dramatic we believe that the propagation of  spreads deceit and confusion in the world and maybe one of the most important things about being a human being is being able to discern whats real and whats fake we want to help make that easier the next time you come across an image that seems like its  please remember our tool it is free to upload and we are donationbased also if youd like to make it easy to share your work on the internet without worrying whether or not someone might believe its actually  then remember us again you can upload your work and get an easily shareable link that helps build trust any and all feedback is greatly appreciated we hope we can make an impact helping promote  dignity and respect,0.9969,positive

AIart,im proconsent and  while it might not prevent job loss i believe its reasonable and respectable that people would like the option to opt out of having their work used for training  without having to remove it from public view or depriving humans of the chance to engage with it in more  ways the staunch  side would say that our artwork is part of the public space and so anything can be done with it but the thing is our understanding of public space was different at the time at which we shared our artwork our understanding of public changes when new tech like  enters the scene and it requires us to reevaluate the situation rather than simply adhere to past rules based on past situations an example i like to use which im sure i dont have to explain to you all because you already feel it inside is a public square where security cameras are already allowed for safety purposes these cameras merely record what happens they dont analyze the data now imagine a new scenario where the cameras are not just recording but also using advanced  to analyze your movements behavior and facial features to create detailed virtual profiles or clones of you in many jurisdictions this added layer of data analysis could be considered invasive or intrusive surveillance and people might reasonably want to opt out of it yet opting out shouldnt mean you have to avoid public spaces or wear disguises to prevent being captured and analyzed by these cameras that would be pretty dystopian that said i understand the arguments of the  side that requiring consent could concentrate power in the hands of big companies that can afford to pay for it and to that i say i dont know but just because we havent come to a reasonable solution yet doesnt mean that the notion of consent should be thrown by the way side at the very least until we can find legal protections that are reasonable we can encourage consent by choosing to support models that use consensuallysourced data similar to how we might opt for local food businesses that source their products in ways we believe are ethical in fact i think this backlash has already started to make a tiny difference to companies who care about their public perception another idea might be government or thirdparty grants aimed specifically at supporting ethical  development among smaller companies or academic researchers so to reiterate being proconsent wont save jobs from automation which i think is the genuine source of rage and grief for that other forms of protection like more government funding for the arts a universal basic income etc might be nice but i still think seeking consent or some sort of reasonable protections is the right thing to do ethically and we shouldnt give up on finding ways to do so and as more of a meta point just because we disagree on some things with people who are  it doesnt mean we cant agree on some things we can leave room for nuance our independent evaluation of the situation and for humility we dont know all the answers yet but we can work towards figuring them out in a way that can benefit the most people this paragraph doesnt apply to everybody but it does apply to some of us thoughts,0.995,positive

AIart,can someone explain to me why the democratization of  by normal people not studios and companies is bad to preface this im pro  note my capitalization of  because thats the only part of  i like i think stuff like having chatgpt writing books actually does lack creativity this is because i feel that  is still able to retain human creativity that things like chatgpt books cannot ive read a few posts here that disagree with that but the reason why i think so is that with the many tools created to help refine  such as controlnet i do think that utilizing those tools one can draw whats within their head the way i see it someone who just types a random  in  or worse have chatgpt make them a  is uncreative someone who has an actual idea of what the want use controlnet maybe even their own editing through photoshop and such applications is creative one of the reasons i like  and probably lots of people is because of how it saves time and ease of access im currently in college before i went i told my parents that i wanted to major in the arts specifically d especially since i took ccdi in highschool they then continuously yelled at me until my ears bled till i switched to computer science which i havent actually started cause you have to take like fucking math classes beforehand i still do some d modeling though its not very goodminecraft model level and its mainly a hobby at this point since im more preoccupied working and getting through classes but while i think im somewhat passable at d d  has always escaped me my sister and cousins are really good which always frustrated me cause the best i could ever do was while tracing i have tried things like searching up videos to learn in my spare time the closest i ever got to an actual  education was a single  class i sneaked into my schedule in my first semester which was actually stressful as hell and complicated this caused me to lose interest in d  almost entirely i still like  especially manga but i never really thought about making it my creative passions rn actually go into writing and reading books cause i admit that im more of a book lover than an  lover hence why i dislike the idea of chatgpt written books  has somewhat reinvigorated that spirit for me and i think its true for the average joe note i say average joe i dont mean redditors or twitter users like rn im a college student whose recently found work as a security guard and i still probably have more free time than most people my parents for example works from most of their free time is usually watching tv till or sometimes even and thats pretty much every adult as far as im aware many people just dont have the time or passion to study to make good  i think its a hard pill some people here need to swallow sure the actual costs of pen and paper is very little but time spent is quite big people learn at different rates yes maybe there are geniuses who can pick up a pen and start making masterpieces in a few months but many people are not like that hell for most people  anything other than a rectangle in point perspective is a hard task there is a reason why people say it takes years to learn how to become a master combine that with stereotypes like  is an extremely hard and competitive business to get into my parents actually told me this to dissuade me from choosing  as a career of how fine  is dumb banana taped to a wall or a money laundering scheme lots of people decide that  isnt for them if your own of those people who stuck it to society and followed their whims anyway congrats you have a stronger will than me at which point  is introduced giving those people who thought they could never do something creative the ability to without having to spend hours in something that could possibly become a dead end and personally speaking i dont see why thats wrong we can split hairs on whether or not someone is an  if they use  or if  is  but i think the vast majority of people dont really care i personally speaking dont see myself as an  or other people who use  as artists they want an outlet for their creativity that doesnt require a gratuitous amount of dedication and time like for example in the rstablediffusion subreddit someone shared a story of their friend wanting to use  so they recommended comfyui only for the friend to pay for  because they just wanted the image of a dragon so this basically sums what the actual public outside of the circlejerks think of   can also be used to enhance short videos being able to produce cgi for low to zero cost for example corridor digitals rock paper scissors short which i fucking loved since it showed that even one person can create something high  i also dont think that  is actually gonna replace human creativity mainly because i think theres a difference between a commissioned  and fine  though that line can be blurred now obviously theres the idea of oversaturation where uncreative or lazy people will take over and flood the market something we can already see with the amount of anime girls dancing and   porn there are however i think that oversaturation isnt a bad thing long term personally i think oversaturation is an unfortunate but needed consequence of trends once oversaturation takes hold people become disinterested in trends thus allowing for the creation of new media from boredom and be recognized for being different this can be easily seen in the movie industry with how superhero movies had a stranglehold on the market till endgame thus allowing for movies like everything everywhere all at once to be created from what i see on twitter too i dont think anyone can really deny its also oversaturated with lots of commisioned porn and of course there is things like deepfake porn which i dislike but i do think there will probably be regulations for it in the future i think  and  is fine as something hobbyists use as long as they make it clear they use  it becomes a problem when companies use it because companies dont have regard for people they just want to save as much money as they can and there actions have much bigger consequences than the average joe shmoe i remember on anitwitter the japanese studio wit had teamed up with netflix to make a d anime short with  backgrounds problem said backgrounds were shit another problem though they had actual  who worked on the concept of the background and edited it they fired over a people this is bad especially when the backgrounds were really bad like clearly no editing was done even with the  like redditors couldve done better levels of bad then theirs also stuff like the writers strike and kwebbelkop  which threaten real jobs this is what i consider bad about  not its democratization but the abuse of companies using it in fact ill say this is the one thing the big corpos did right making it all public some people might say this is the worst case scenario but i think even worse wouldve been if google openai stability sold these  generators strictly to companies not only wouldve trampled on the possibilities of this tech for use in only like adverts but people may not of even known this was a thing till people being fired and  being used to market everything,0.9962,positive

where hardcoded law takes precedence we already have seen what happens when an  approaches the court without a fullyfledged argument with how karla ortizs side of the case against stability and  was thrown out because they didnt specify what stability and  stole from them xb so what argument is there against  i think there are a few but i also think that any legal action will only work to varying degrees based on my research of copyright laws disclaimer i am not a lawyer nor have any education in law this are strictly my opinions based on research i did on  and copyright laws ill be using webpages and sources found on and anybody is welcome to correct me if i get anything wrong xb xb first off its important to realize how    actually works ill be using  in this post as this is the product i know most about so how do training  models work ill try not to use analogies comparing it to a human cause thats incorrect basically what happens is that the images that the  is training upon is covered in gaussian noise xb meaning that the  doesnt actually see the full image itself only small patterns it uses algorithmic pattern recognition to see patterns in that image the image usually has a caption and as the  trains on more and more images it sees more and more patterns and associates these patterns with the captions because of this many ml scientists believe that training isnt copyright infringement as the  doesnt save the full image only patterns and patternsideas arent copyrightable subject matter of copyright b in no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea procedure process system method of operation concept principle or discovery regardless of the form in which it is described explained illustrated or embodied in such work copyright law of the united states and related laws contained in ttle of the united states code pg xb however is this really true overfitting and recent study of image replication i would like to credit uitzmoepi for posting this at first i thought this was a redux of that study that tried to say that sd copies by literally pulling a monkey on the typewriter bullshit it did the opposite and proved that even after generating over million images the images only get around close to actual training data however it wasnt it was actually quite an eyeopening read the relevant part is part where through prompting based on image captions the researchers managed to make  base model replicate its training data with surprising accuracy as stated in the paper itself this is possibly the consequence of overfitting overfitting is what happens when due to improper training the  starts generating images that are copies of its training data this can be due to many reasons such as a dataset that is too small training on too little steps or training on too many steps one of the reasons why this problem may have shown up in sd is because of the number of image duplicates in the dataset to sum it up the  has seen the same pattern so many times that its not only learned the pattern but the entire image and now when prompted it will recreate it so is it that cut and dry sd has shown to be able to replicate images with the right  and as such is copyright infringement well not quite there are two big problems with this xb stability did not create the dataset they train upon one of the biggest points brought against  is that it was created by stealing millions of images online unfortunately legally speaking this is not the case  and  use laionb a database of images that was crawled from the internet by a thirdparty company however they are legally allowed to do this due to the reasoning that its an archival database for research purposes which are exempt from copyright limitations on exclusive rights reproduction by libraries and archives a except as otherwise provided in this title and notwithstanding the provisions of section it is not an infringement of copyright for a library or archives or any of its employees acting within the scope of their employment to reproduce no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work except as provided in subsections b and c or to distribute such copy or phonorecord under the conditions specified by this section if copyright law of the united states and related laws contained in ttle of the united states code pg the laionb itself is under a cc license which allows anyone to download and use the dataset for their own purposes basically stability and  scoot under copyright laws by using a research database that is free for anybody to use copyright laws are stringent as all hell yeah while i was doing my research i came to a seemingly unsavory conclusion the strictness of copyright laws doesnt really work against  my research tells me that copyright is pretty strict in that reparations can only happen if one can prove its actually been infringed so the only way to reasonably prove that stability committed infringement is if you can prove beyond a doubt that the  is capable of replicating a copyrighted image without the use of imgimg or a different model in other words one can only sue if they have reasonable evidence to suggest that their work is overfitted in sd this unfortunately only covers a small portion of artists for all artists to get reparations it would seem that the only way is to somehow prove that each and every image sds base model has created and ever will create infringes on some image in the original laion b database xb even then theres another problem is it derivative or transformative xb derivative or transformative derivative work is basically defined as taking a copyrighted work and adding some stuff to it but not changing anything about the actual work such as putting an article in a textbook in these cases it is possible to sue companies but one can only sue for the copyrighted work the article they cant do anything about the additions hence why i said copyright is stringent a derivative work is a work based upon one or more preexisting works such as a translation musical arrangement dramatization fictionalization motion picture version sound recording  reproduction abridgment condensation or any other form in which a work may be recast transformed or adapted a work consisting of editorial revisions annotations elaborations or other modifications which as a whole represent an original work of authorship is a derivative work copyright law of the united states and related laws contained in ttle of the united states code pg b the copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material the copyright in such work is independent of and does not affect or enlarge the scope duration ownership or subsistence of any copyright protection in the preexisting material copyright law of the united states and related laws contained in ttle of the united states code pg in such cases something like those people on twitter who simply outpainted famous paintings could probably be sued since they didnt add anything to the  transformative work is when someone takes a copyrighted work but changes it some way to give it a new meaning the best example of transformative works is parody where for the sake of comedy one is allowed to infringe on the copyright of another work this is how shows like family guy rick and morty the simpsons snl can get away with skits that commit copyright infringement because of the transformative work clause its possible that even if  is legally considered as a super advanced photobashcollage machine if the generations are significantly different enough from the original data stability wont actually have to pay for any of the  it was trained on,0.996,positive
AIart,im screaming inside ive had enough being commissioned by this client i feel like screaming this client of mine fucking dont know what its like to draw from scratch wtf they want to me to draw a couple holding and kissing each other with complex background never said any specific position or gave me any reference so i draw what was close to how they like it just front view of them its an initial sketch anyway and i sent them that then they said can we spin them the other way so theyre facing away i was like i breath deeply and just closed my eyes but im raging hello is my hand a magic tool that spin shit like a d app would do wtf gotta draw that from scratch again im gonna lose it honestly man why do they feel entitled they havent even paid me yet they was supposed to after i gave them a rough sketch thats me being fucking generous other  would let them pay before starting i hate this i wanna enjoy  not stressing i feel like quitting on accepting commissions question to artists please since its a rough sketch i just didnt add any complex details yet and only planned to when i perfect the lineart so they told me at the very start on the details or objects to add after i gave them a rough sketch they sent replies like they thought i wasnt gonna add more and that the thing i sent them is the final design are they thinking that example a window without detailed plants i roughly draw a caricature version if it first but i plan to draw it very clearly during the perfecting lineart stage but they said oh there needs to be plants on the window like bitch i know im the  here wtf another example is when they want me to add an apron on the table i did a little rough sketch there but they said that looks alittle off and missing something bitch its called rough sketch its insulting on my fucking part i felt like they dont trust my skill im not their flipping graphic designer im an  and its expected to trust my artistic views wtf please fellow artists id like to know if im in the wrong here if i am then maybe im not cut out to be an  accepting commissions i initially want to make  for myself i was just trying commissioning for curiousity but fuck this is stressful please enlighten me do i really need to add the additonal objects they need during rough sketch is it like a clients right thing maybe im just not informed with the practical stuff also btw this is fanart i think they disregard being professional because they thought this is just entertainment shit and dont deserve the kind commercial commissioners treatment what do yall think,-0.2512,negative

AIart,doesnt copy the images so its not theft and why its a bad argument imagine that you wrote a book someone copied that book and started selling it effectively profiting from your work without consent or compensation when you confront them they say well its not like i stole your book you still have it in your possession dont you so nothing has been stolen i mean yeah the book has not been stolen but now you have to share the profits from your book with someone who hasnt contributed to it at all and your sales are endangered as well because they can sell at a lower price than you since they dont have any costs to cover to break even so while theres no stealing in the  sense of the word theres still harm in this and copyright is supposed to protect the authors from this harm to allow them to share their work publicly without the risk that their profits will be affected by this so just like it doesnt matter that the book hasnt been physically taken away it also doesnt matter that the image hasnt been copied what matters are the consequences of this action does someone else profit from the work you created are your own profits affected by this then your images have been stolen or in other words used without your consent or compensation edit the whole discussion below can be summarized as me it doesnt matter if its copying or not what matters is that the original  is harmed by someones using their   folk  doesnt copy tho,0.823,positive
AIart,im sitting right in the middle of this war and im just curious on what yall think of people like me i should probably not be here because it will probably attract negative karma but i cant help but look for trouble so here we go xb im an  i have been  out of passion for like years now and honestly i was starting to get tired ive been very demotivated lately hating how i could barely do of the ideas in my head even at the times where i was finishing over drawings a day while its still not quite there yet maybe i need to learn more open source  has given me hope for the future and it kinda pulled me out of that tired mindset xb im not a  writer and i dont think that writing a  alone makes anyone an  maybe an explorer or map maker what im doing instead is using everything i can to have as much control as possible over the generation i draw a rough lineart to use with controlnet to decide the composition and poses i draw a color layer to use with imgimg so i can control the atmosphere and illumination i keep blending and enhancing the results in my  program in order to keep it in the direction i want i can even swap models in and out blending things together as i change specific parts of the image the end result isnt an interpretation of what i typed it is my idea just rendered with a slightly different and sometimes superior artstyle to my own xb as i see it the finished product isnt entirely my work i wouldnt deny that i see it as nonconsented assistance and as someone who has been sulking for years over artists who are better than me this is hard to resist and i dont even know if i should xb if we had a good opensource model that was ethically trained i would love that but due to this polarization that will probably be more and more difficult as things go on having enough artists agree to contribute to a pure model trained from scratch would probably be hard i would still do it but i figure it would be hard to get even just a million pictures xb this hate for the machine is scaring me though because if the wrong laws pass people like me could lose the freedom to experiment with this stuff while big corporations can still manage the resources to create training data theyre allowed to use and then they will control this powerful tool not us sure no one will come knocking on my door if i finetune my own model but if you guys kill the opensource  scene i will lose something that is promising to reignite my creative flame losing that hope that i can chase most of my ideas after all xb now for things like  which purposefully avoid making their tools artistfriendly im more than happy to see that burned to the ground to be honest so i dont know where i sit actually the artists are scaring me more so i usually feel better near the  stuff especially when trying to learn more on how i can best use it but im curious on what that makes me i dont mind the idea that my works have been used to make some model out there better but i know that doesnt invalidate the people who dislike that just because im cool with it doesnt mean everyone should be i understand the stress but i also want to make sure my concerns dont go unheard xb now i kinda feel like maybe this isnt the best place and that this discussion belongs more on raiwars but i feel like this is the place i wanted to vent this to the most especially since im after the antiml perspective sorry if its not appropriate,0.988,positive

AIart,lets share some ml programs that we actually like so id like to change the conversation a bit about the perception of  programs to something more upbeat considering the earned negative reputation thats been garnered by image generators and large language models thats been putting a lot of people into cycles of depression and addiction for a lot of the people who use them way too much for context im an industrial designer and for the past years ive experimented in several processes involving  to make unique products with some integrated into my daily workflow as theyre intrinsically linked to the technology that my current employer is developing i also do some d  d rendering  work on the side which has involved some ml use in the case of the d work the best use i can think of is that when done right without taking data from millions without consent ml can create things that are either unintuitive or impossible for a person to make as it would either take way too much time to make or require thinking beyond what our brains are suited to eg complex parametric patterns so i think maybe those of us who do use some actually good tools those that can be classified as such could list them here and get some others to try them out these are the ones i like rhino grasshopper plugins biomorpher evolutionary solver to rapidly make several iterations of shapes and patterns from what data you put in and what bounds you give it so you can analyse lots of different patterns simultaneously kangaroo physics realtime simulations on your d geometry to adapt it to different aestheticfunctional requirements ive most recently used it to relax surfaces in furniture design for cleaner aesthetics pufferfish i havent used this much but some people have done some really cool  work using it to adapt and optimise really complex patterns that us humans cant intuitively make by hand topology optimisation also known as  design ntopology is the one i like the most but there are more mainstream ones great for creating eccentric forms around specific functional paramaters that you can build a design language around also really good for reducing material wastage these examples are all just good old fashioned maths no unconsensual data scraping anyone else here have examples to share,0.9917,positive

AIart,is krita really the best free app for android tablets hey everyone i recently bought a stand alone  tablet and switched to that from using photoshop on my desktop i did a lot of research on  apps before i made the switch but it seems like a pretty crucial thing that nobody talks about and i also neglected to realise was that the reviews i was watching were not always on tablets they were on  screens connected to computers whilst krita seems great and it may be that im just still learning how to use it it actually doesnt seem all that well set up for tablet use i feel like if i had a keyboard specifically the shift key or the shortcut to deselect andor switch between the brusheyedroppereraser tools i would be able to do stuff a lot bettereasier and that sort of defeats the point of being on the tablet so what else are people using to draw on their tablets or do i just need to learn krita better was pretty gutted to learn photoshop was not on android but im not rich enough to pay ipad prices haha try sketchbook its better designed for tablet use its a  app though not an image editing app like photoshop so you may need to change your workflow anyway to make the best of it problem with krita its not meant for android devices look into hipaint infinite painter medibang lets you use all brushes if you watch an ad the best free app for pc and tablet everything else is not free or trash you can use your android tablet as a nd screen with desktop if you still have one but no graphics tablet superdisplay one time payment is good for using android fir  with pc   on android with krita is fine i think if you need to use lots of the tools image editing options beyond that i find the layout being ported from desktop fiddly even with a keyboard but obviously keyboard helps a lot infinite painter is far more intuitive on a tablet does have a few bugs but also has plenty of adjustment layer options etc compared to procreate its a time payment i like hi paint these days but i only do basic drawings and layering for me it works well just has some bugs as its in early days closest replica of procreate for android before this i used infinite painter but the ui didnt suit my workflow i didnt know there was an android version for krita but to be honest krita can be very heavy thats because i used it for many years when i drew on android i used ibis paint a lot i like infinite painter and heavypaint i use photoshop and sketchable plus on ny surface pro xthe best application ive found for tablet  is the tablet pro app its a shortcut manager that is very useful ipads arent all that expensive though it depends of the model you can get a m or m ipad pro or a newer ipad air for a good price whats good about an ipad is that if you are on the apple ecosystem you can mirror your macbook to your ipad via sidecar i prefer infinite painter and  mode the free version in clip studio i pay for csp but if i have no other option i would have sticked to krita the amount of features krita had is only second to csp and sometimes i wish csp had some of kritas featurs sure people can make masterpieces even on ms paint but the main appeal of krita is the huge number of features incomparable by most free android app out there if you learned to use those features well your  time will be cut down by half or even if its speed efficient you look for krita is best if you have gotten over the learning curve and the fact that it had a desktop version is importand if you want to keep your works easily editable if you want to just draw then any app out there can work krita is good but there are also many good  apps on android krita works best of bigger displays such as those inches or larger because there are so many palettes controls buttons other good apps to consider are clip studio paint medibang sketchbook pro and more httpswwwparkablogscompicturealternativesadobedrawingpaintingsoftwarehttpswwwparkablogscompicturealternativesadobedrawingpaintingsoftware i use krita on a laptop while some of the issues youre having may be due to device differences i also found krita just had a pretty steep learning curve i would persist with it through a couple of paintings before making a desicionit has an extraordinary amount of capability for free  but it isnt always intuitive to use ive used sketchbook bro for years super user friendly its free but some features are behind a pay wall but its like to perminently unlock everything they had a recent update that really made it more useful hi paint is better but ive used medibang  on my profile its everything you need,0.9996,positive
AIart,my first finished  in crita  omg krita as someone who mainly uses krita i totally understand the difficulties with it getting into it for the first time can be especially difficult overall i really love this piece especially for being a completely new program to you its really well done i love the color usage and the composition the themes of it resonate with me too i recommend just playing around in krita to see what you can and cant do and if you continue to use it id love to see your progress d it was very difficult for me to finish something in a new  it was very difficult with colors for me i so much get use to gradient map in photoshop and in krita its very diferent i think i will try to draw in colors from start i dont like how look colors on her face and clothes but i like this texture effect look way more interesting than i could do in photoshop really nice  took a look at your profile and most of your drawings have that demonic vibe going on with them do usually create  this way anyway gave you a follow ill take this is a great piece of  archangel thank you i would like to try more in it i worked almost years in photoshop and i feel me very weird to try a new  but to be honest i needed to leave photoshop long time ago texture thank you yes at this moment i draw mostly something more from the horror side it can change i had started to draw because i wanted to draw pin ups thank you thank you yeahh i could never get into photoshop as good as it is because of adobe ive been into digital  for around years and have tried a lot of programs krita by far is my favorite but if it doesnt work for you always branch out theres a lot of good free and paid programs out there maybe you cant see it because of the  but it has an oil  texture effect honestly it kinda looks like symbolic  workhttpsgcokgspckfdosymbolism to me its really good do you do this as a hobby or work,0.9941,positive
AIart,problem with a  tablet and dual monitors i have this problem where if i have my two monitors on while i draw my tablet does the thing where pardon my clumsy explanation it treats both of the monitors as one long narrow screen and so the speed at which the cursor moves horizontally is wildly different from how it moves vertically bc the tablet itself ofc has the dimensions of a single monitor and that really messes up trying to draw anything lol i was wondering if anyone knew of a hardtofind setting or a piece of  i could use to temporarily limit my cursor just to a certain area thing is that my tablet is an ancient dinosaur wacom bamboo mtea that does not have fuctional drivers for my system win so i cant just set that in the tablets own settings i tried to google some ideas but most people dealing with problems that come from multiple monitors seem to stuggle with video game related issues though the price i have to pay for this problem is just that i gotta turn off my other monitor and cant watch a full sized video on it while i draw so like its not gonna kill me or anything haha as the other person stated you need the drivers to be installed for you to be able to map the tablet and screen area using an older driver may work or use what they call legacy drivers also available on wacoms site if however you are on a mac it might not work as apple has decided to brick older tablets from working you can also try using an open source and free driver called opentabletdriver on either windows or mac ive never had to use it myself but people who are having issue with wacoms drivers often use it instead you will not be able to fix the issue until you can configure the tablet with either  there is no other option that i am aware of you could try opentabletdriver httpsdocsthesevenpenscomdrawtabguidesdriversopentabletdriveropentabletdriverwindowshttpsdocsthesevenpenscomdrawtabguidesdriversopentabletdriveropentabletdriverwindows on the wacom site you should be able to download previous versions of the driver are you able to find one that works if at all possible i would recommend upgrading to an intuos maybe a refurb or used you will have a better experience hah honestly a new tablet has actually been on my bucket list for quite a while but the spirit of a stingy old miser keeps haunting me and whispering but like of its features still woooooork even with percent of the features of a bamboo operational its still not as good of an experience as an intuos pro imho its worth splurging for,0.9597,positive
AIart,career paths side hustles for a year old who has a passion for  and creative design not too familiar with the possibilities but she doesnt seem interested at all in stem currently highschool courses are a hassle to pass as she shows no interest all attempts and efforts in changing study habits tutors and accommodations werent successful so we are trying to change trajectory and find her interest perhaps theres a degree diploma or certificate she can look forward to where itll encourage putting in an effort in her last year in highschool inorder to secure the diploma perhaps theres a path she can begin now to build a portfolio and then continue on after highschool to get fully licensedaccredited any suggestions are much appreciated i was very much in a similar boat artsy kid with no desire to do anything else as my creativity was what drove me eventually i actually ended up pursuing entreprenuership as i already had the artistic skills i needed but wanted to have the business skills to turn my  into my full time career i would encourage her to decide exactly what she wants to do with her  is she interested in animation  comics things of that nature and what other skills does she have that can tie into her talent i was naturally inclined to boss people around and take charge of projects which led to my path down into entreprenuership having an area that shes extra experienced with will make her not only more confident in her abilities but is practical for looking for jobs in the industry as well encourage her to experiment ive changed my major times and will probably change it more she doesnt have to go to some fancy expensive  school if she already has the talent and the fundamentals finding an area to tie into her  will not only make that area more interesting to study because who wants to learn about business when you could learn about building an  business but also give her the wide array of skills she needs to possibly adapt to whatever the future could throw at her personally im jealous that she has someone so willing to support her artistic journey support from family and friends can often make or break an artists resolve good luck it highly depends on where you live i have passion for  and i went to university with graphic design in my country there arent many other positions who offer jobs for creatives if she wants to work a regular jobs look at what  related professions are available in your area if she wants to work as a freelancer then she has to focus in building a portfolio and social media presence so its easier in the future to find clients in any case at this age she must put a lot of work to polish her skills work on fundamentals watch tutorials drawmake designs etc amazon merch she can sign up for  competitions open up commissions and try finding clients in upwork maybe get a few months subscription to some professional  like zbrush or maya or adobe creative suite and get that steep student discount if you can she can learn everything on youtube and she can make stuff to post on her socials maybe get some commissions from friends and family if this is something you hope she pursues professionally then shell have to learn professional  theres some missing information here how far into  is she does her  look good is she just starting im really not sure if i should suggest what to purchase as a baseline for digital artists or if shes already got a hold on  and just needs a money funnel ipad air apple pencil gen procreate for  anywhere if she has a pc at a desk then a  monitor like a huion screen a perpetual license to clip studio paint theres sites like artfol artsy deviant  danbooru bonus magma to draw with friends sorry theres no links im not sure if theyre allowed here she can also show a specific  pieces progress pics sketch pic outline pic flats colors pic final render pic on social media or on tiktokyoutube shorts as a video slideshow to gain followers and make money that way just like how samdoesarts has his own youtube community with patreon subscriptions anything you as a parent try to guide her toward has a chance of blowing up in your face teens are wired to do the opposite of what their parents tell them to do its just their nature and if they have an interest in something creative few things destroy an organic interest creative outlet like having it become a job just let them have that for themselves not everything has to result in a paycheck they dont need a job rn they need to enjoy their extremely fleeting adolescence while they still have it with the most possible respect stop being a helicopter parent you are smothering them professional matters will sort themselves out in time you dont have to minmax their education youre only putting them on a oneway ticket to burnout in their mid twenties and you will regret it i was naturally inclined to boss people around and take charge of projects which led to my path down into entreprenuership oh man we are polar opposites i go into projects declaring outright that i will not take charge under any circumstance teamwork asking me to delegate is like asking me to share my tendies with the class so if youre the opposite of me you must be great at delegating jobs a pleasure to work with and also get things done on time not sure i can link here but this was something i

AIart,how can i land a concept  job in months i have about months to land a concept  job ive levelled up my skills learned enough d and everything now i just need to complete the portfolio all i have is an  station pro account and i need to land a remote concept  job without fail can anyone suggest a solid plan tips tricks or anything that i can use to make sure i land it edit damn from all the answers it clearly isnt in the realm of possibility to do that and apparently the industrys too hard to break into from what i researched then youd have a better chance being a creator relatively than getting a fulltime concept  job ill update if i do manage to crack something concept job with no experience good luck youre definitely going to fail and get a lot of rejection anyone who tells you they have a way to make sure you land it is lying to your face if you have a strong portfolio then show the work i know if i want to hire someone within pieces of work so if you have too much and its too diverse its an instant pass for me theres no shame in getting a side job in order to pay the bills while you work on your portfolio if you have no experience itll be a long time before you comfortably get into the field im in a similar boat although not up to that level id love to dip my feet into that type of work in the future from all the research ive done landing a concept  job seems very difficult general freelancing might be your best bet im still figuring things out myself but i wish you luck in finding a job have a low rate at first just to get some work to put on your portfolio or resume or work probono for charity things check out catchafireorg you can offer up your design skills as a charity type thing there you will fail unless your portfolio is on par with the masters and you can churn out a piece in a few hours tops then its chance try smaller studios concept  jobs arent in that high demand since a lot of people want to do it id reccomend local game dev hangout spots and carry your portfolio and business cards with you long term id suggest you become a millionaire by making a patreon funded porn game youll never finish or learn d  if you want a job in games or movies you dont have a complete portfolio yet and you need a job in months realistically you cant thats just not how the industry works no one is getting hired with no experience and an incomplete portfolio finish your portfolio then start applying for small freelance jobs and build from there maybe it wouldnt hurt to start with a link to the portfolio for the moment i will assume that you have a competitive portfolio however the moment you want to enter the concept  market is the worst in the past year concept artists have been replaced by subscriptions to mid or another  generator obviously it is not about the whole department but about the entry jobs at least for now as a result be ready to answer the question what can you do and can not be done by an  and one more thing i personally dont know anyone who to have been employed in some artistic field based on institutional applications good concept artists are stolen from one producer to another as an immediate advice see which projects you can get involved in give your best and hope they get noticed look for contests anything from world creation to chair design our field of activity is different from anything else in the corporate culture we are tolerated there because our work is necessary although no one knows exactly why bud i hate to tell u but this is unrealistic the  industry is rough and harshly competitive not having a portfolio is going to be a huge hinderance itll depend entirely on your skills super competitive industry though wouldnt count on it how have a god tier portfolio and be one of the top artists in the country then have some good contacts in the industry post your work what else do you reckon i could aim for jobwise really cant seem to find many openings for other  jobs though,0.9953,positive
AIart,is it possible realistic im years old with absolute zero skills in  i want to make a living by  my time is limited how long might it take im worried ill just waste my time pursuing something that others professionals learned years ago being in puberty not even trying hard what would you do im d  lacking d im a concept  have been for years all this shit you hear about there not being enough jobs and it being competitive theyve been saying about concept  careers since the early s when i started same exact things i had everyone under the sun tell me that when i was going to  school i was making a mistake and how there isnt enough jobs while theres some truth to it dont let it discourage you the real thing to consider though the million dollar question is if youre ready to take the plunge and dedicate if you know it in your heart and its your sole desire to be a concept  or  for a living or whatever probably a good chance youll make it depending how driven you are drive can take you extremely fucking far in the  world or in anything really same with being highly critical of your own work and always pushing to do better to me those two things are more important than anything else cause if you have drive and a critical eye towards your own work youll do the necessary steps to get to the skill level that is needed in whatever timeframe youre working with getting to the point though itll take a few years at least of daily practice and hard fucking work but depending how badly you want it it might not feel like work to get a proper  foundation youll need to learn perspective and anatomy first and foremost and hours put in will really matter its why you gotta ask yourself how badly you want to be an  and if youll be critical of your progress and work cause its a mountain of work to get to a professional level but in my experiences that ride was a fucking blast id do it all over again if i could hit rewind but my ally through all of it was drive and being highly critical of my own work i still find things i couldve done better for every thing i feel i did right in a sketch or  but yeah its hard work like everyone says but if youre driven it wont feel like work just gotta search your soul and ask how badly you want it if it would bring you happiness which is the most important thing the go for it bud d market is tougher than d market just less jobs if you cant make it in d well d isnt technically easier or anything if thats what youre thinking its extremely difficult to draw and paint to the proficiency of a pro also since you say you cant draw to any competency i have to ask what makes you think youd even enjoy it as a profession its not the same feeling as doodling at a high level to answer your question though id say maybe six to eight years of full time solid learning school mentorships hours a week will get you to a pro level youll find out in the first year whether you actually want to do it youre gonna suck soo bad compared to first and second year students most kids in  school will be light years ahead of you because they actually know how to draw already the emotional toll of being criticized in front of them will be ego shattering over and over its shattering for many really good students that being said let me know if you do it ill send you a case of beer when you get your first job there are plenty of artists who didnt start  or  until they were older than you are now yuko shimizu springs to mind not everyone is a child  prodigy honestly man like the others said itll be extremely hard for a while sure you can do it but you have to learn so much a list of things youll most likely need to learn people basic physics as in how hair flows how a body will stand or fall realistically how clothes folds and stays over the body line of actions contruction face expressions body shape hair accurate anatomy shading from anything to buildings skin clothes animals nature shading perspective multiple point perspective applies to anything and everything if you want to make things not be in one perspective always and actually have variety in what you make it is a must backgrounds landscapes buildings multiple point perspective props weapons misc everyday items material clothing different materials used for clothing nature buildings clothing physics color color theory color context color contrast basically anything you can learn about color and color theory this is just what i can think of learning  is an insane marathon that yes while feasible dont expect to make any stable income out of it anytime soon until you can have a portfolio you can sell i wouldnt say the occasional selling of a  or  to random people or acquaintances is stable income youtube pinterest and occasionally google images are your best friends unfortunately i would avoid a lot of new references from post as  is almost never an accurate way to practice from reference on google you can add before things to look up to get started especially on youtube how to draw for beginners how to use shapes to draw how to draw using construction how to draw using shapes as construction how to draw anatomy how to draw perspective how to set  goals for myself how to draw with goals in mind how to learn to draw with goals in mind how to draw using references how to pick correct references for  how to find references for  how to shade how to shade shapes how to understand shading shading may be difficult to grasp for a bit just remember that everything is made out of shapes and that everything has a lightsource and think about how that lightsource interacts with the shapes dont be afraid to go super dark for dark shadows when needed and same thing for light shading loomis method how to draw figure  line of

to draw _____ its best to have an understanding instead of trying to learn something blindlyexample for more niche searches how to draw armor stars planets flowers plants space cars planes tress moon people you can look up tutorials for that were very helpful to my  journey proko drawlikeasir marc brunet mikeymegamega jadokar excaliblader samdoesart bluebiscuits bradsartschool ssavaart if you find anyone you like make sure you screenshot or sub to the to remember who they are or whatever so you can keep watching their videos dont listen to the people who say to not use reference it is the best way to learn especially real life references it is not cheating no matter what people say choose them wisely clear references help a lot however dont straight up copy something or trace and say its your own for example straight up using something from another  like a design or pose etc then it might best to give them credit pace yourself and be nice to yourself and set realistic expectations because at first since you said you have no experience youre gonna not be so great or even all that good for a bit probably while yes many will say  is about enjoying it or just making  for making  youre also on the side of doing it for financial stability so you have to have some discipline for it and try to recognize where to improve and what your strengthsweaknesses are set goals for yourself refer back to my list of how to if youre struggling with this its important to set some goals for yourself on what you wanna learn instead of just trying to tackle everything at once because it can be overwhelming and counterproductive you will not master things in one try or ever again dozen tries even if it looks good so try to refine your skills so you dont go rusty make a list of things you have practiced so you can go back and refine and practice more the things in my lists ive given are all things i think one would need if you want to be able to have a diverse skill set and open more opportunities to you so dont be afraid to keep learning new things and even telling yourself oh i get to learn x and then i can learn y to give yourself more encouragement in the long run it is a good mentality to have this is a lot but it is feasible and ive made you a road map if youre actually serious about  as a career then it might be best to refer to this during your journey good luck atleast all these online resources beat  school prices in terms of the learning aspect as you can learn for free if yo find yourself stuck and feeling like youre not learning or understanding a certain concept well then go back to the basics and look up tutorials or whatever tutorials you learned from as sometimes we can miss or just forget some details that help alot it sure helps me when i feel like something im trying to learn isnt improving much making a living with  is incredibly hard especially with the popularity and  of  images raising besides that you also have to learn how to draw first the people you see online posting incredible pieces did it for ages spending many many hours of their time  and practicing talent can only get you so far the rest is diehard practice and once you managed to learn your next enemy is the algorithm to earn a living youll have to do social networking twitter tiktok instagram etc and if you dont keep feeding the page with new content the algorithm will just swallow you and nobody will see your works i am talking about posting up to pictures a day btw improving your workflow will be a must do for you theres pages that are specifically for  work as well but unless youre already a very popular  who makes great work you will have to start with small prices tldr itll be crazy hard i started at around that age i work in the industry now of course its possible some of the best didnt start until their s but if your only goal is to make a buck or expand your portfolio youll drown remember that even to someone whos been practicing every day since they were years old being able to make enough money to live off of is like winning the lottery youre talking about one of the most competitive and underpaid job markets in the world where most people have been working their entire lives working themselves to the bone for decades just so they have a chance to work hour workdays for pay that frankly isnt worth it if you want to do this you need something deep down to push you to keep going you need to be prepared to work your ass off just as hard as everyone else if not harder and accept that you still probably wont succeed and keep going anyway know that to even stand a chance you need to be very well trained self disciplined know the right people and be able to market your work and yourself as someone who can do anything lastly no matter how good you are how much you practice its gonna take years it simply takes time to do you cant change that anyone can pick up a hobby and be really good at it just practice every day even if you dont see improvement just keep doing it because eventually youre going to get there it is hard thats the truth concept  and  is a competitive job i studied a degree of  years ago and has been studying concept  and  in general on my own also quite a lot and i went to a private academy many years when i was child and i didnt manage to make a living of concept  and  just some small jobs from time to time but i have to say that i am not a dedicated person i wasted a lot of time i dont know about you but i think with years someone can do it with a lot of dedication will take you some years of many hours a day practicing and learning consider your preparation as a full time job you need to be passionate about it otherwhise i dont think its possible it may take you at least years if you are a fast learner and i think or is more realistic id ask this question to some profesional concept artists directly id ask if they know other concept artists that were in the same situation as you one question that i have is if you didnt draw in years or did it a few times why now you want to do it and make a living of it if this is not a passion for you there is many other careers or professions way easier to be successful at and easier to learn dont overthink it if you want to learn buy some books and start grinding regardless learning the  fundamentals will improve your d workflow and work dont worry about how long it will take just try to learn as fast as possible in years youll either be years old knowing how to paint digitally or youll be years old without the ability to paint digitally how good you are at depends on how much time you invest to deliberate practice oh friend i understand your doubts but i was in the same situation five years ago i quit the office at the age of and i just wanted to do something that would bring me pleasure did i know how to draw well it was something really sad but i decided that i had nothing to lose and started trying to sell what i could at that time i literally learned while working if we are talking about a game dev studio then it will be difficult but if you are talking about simple freelancing then just start it will be quite cheap at first but you will earn and gain experience at the same time that way you wont waste time and youll be motivated just draw something that you can do now and show it to people on the relevant sites the demand will motivate you to study and improve in order to take more expensive jobs besides by the time you improve your skills youll already have a good customer base i did exactly that at the time and it worked the issue for me at least is time i simply dont have enough time to get better and be at a level that will get me jobs and i cant just spend my time jobless and  until im good enough i have yet to go to college and im stuck between choosing artwhat i truly want and some other major that will at least guarantee some money im years into d now but wanted to

AIart,what  tablet should i get my  tablet recently broke and i need to buy a new one but ive seen on twitter that a lot of tablet companies have been using andor promoting  in particular ive seen wacom xppen ugee huion and gaomon have all done something in favor of  xppen apologized and claimed it was due to an outside vendor that they are no longer working with but that feels a bit disingenuous can anyone recommend a decent tablet from a company that hasnt promoted  that isnt too expensive id personally just go with an ipad if you can afford it procreate is such a great and cheap app and they specifically said that they will not promote  theyre expensive but they are quite good imo buy the best tablet you can afford that helps humans you make  dont worry about the  it doesnt need a tablet if you buy a  tablet based on that you might as well go back to paper and pencil  as annoying as it for a professional  its a tool that can be used to ease a process im not talking about tracing image ajusting or simply posting a  image i am talking about ideas for future drawings help with texture and poses etc procreate is so worth it on the ipad the investment can be a lot up front but the interface is unmatched graphic tablet brands are all big tech companies they are all pro  otherwise they would be left behind so you need to ignore that fact deleted i have only ever had two tablets in my life first was by wacom and didnt have any issues until i lost the wire second was huions cheapest tablet the hp for about i had so many issues with the tablet after a year because their autoupdate program kept breaking my settings only solution was to uninstall and reinstall the tablet drive each time but led up to me having to do that every time i opened my  program then i realized uninstalling the autoupdate program slowed the problem settings still got messed up eventually anyway my last straw was when i accidentally spilled a little water and got burned by the huion tablet ive given up and moved on to the ipad i havent purchased procreate yet but  was surprisingly easier and i used the free version of autodesk sketchbook it was confusing but worked for me im buying procreate soon buy what you can afford maybe get it from a different reseller or second hand agreed procreate isnt my thing but i strictly use my ipad propencil as my tablet i just have other apps most used is csp i dont have a pc so it doubles as a computer for me ive heard only good things about procreate but i know there are issues with apple and other cellphone companies right now because of the stuff in congo so if youre concerned about that i heard secondhand is good my family wont allow me that choice because they prefer new things for whatever reason so i dont have experience with that,0.9934,positive
AIart,alternatives to nightshade for  protection unfortunately my computer doesnt have the requirements to run nightshade while i intend to use glaze most of what im seeing says its mostly to protect against your  being copied im unsure if the swirly overlay patterns actually do anything to screw over the  are there any alternatives to nightshade omg following for answers i joined this forum to ask this question deleted thats the spirit roll over and die no one can own an   thats never been a thing an   can be recognizable but not owned what matters is that we protect the  we create from those styles we artists had never backed down from protecting what is rightfully ours so why start now and let them profit off our backs just because people found a new way to steal  i think youre right  ownership will soon be a thing of the past so i believe  and designers need to reemphasize content and storytelling in my opinion storytelling and content are what sets human and  imagery apart if  copied your  and its functionally the same as your own work then you have a content issue not a plagiarism issue deleted  ownership will soon be a thing of the past  ownership has never been protected by copyright its not even a thing of the present if it were most artists would be spending all their time in court because its a rare  whose influences arent worn on their sleeve  and designers need to emphasize content and storytelling this has always been the case even authors who create abstract work need a damn good  statementstory describing why their work matters if they want it to be taken seriously by anyone with clout in the  world if  copied your  and its functionally the same as your own work then you have a plagiarism issue copyright protection extends beyond copies of original works to substantial similarity if an author can show that someone is using their work to create substantially similar market replacements then they have a solid infringement case,0.7608,positive
AIart,a question for artists since the introduction of  every  is against it and i agree but heres a question i have lets say i hired an  and i want to describe them what i want but its hard so i generate some images  and show them as a reference would doing that be disrespectful or is it jus ta better way of describing what you want asked and answered locking the thread before it gets derailed are you okay with me generating some images with  to show you more clearly what i am looking for i think thats all you need for in order to it not be disrespectful different artists will feel differently about it as its still a divisive issue so just ask you know you can just create an imagevision board right its quite common for a client to send me a collage of images as well as a description for example lets say its an rpg pc  they might send me a photo of someone who facially resembles the character some more images for body type some hairstyles similar to what they envision them having some shots of costumes they like a scan of a particular weapon their character has so lets say were doing a rogue whose appearance is japanese they might say she looks like this japanese idol but she has a bigger bust like this her hair is like this i want her in a dress like this except purple and she should be holding this weapon with photos showing what sort of things are inspiring them keep in mind that the  image is tainted by the machines interpretation of your  so what youre showing to the  is your idea mixed with the ais idea and if you find it hard to describe your idea with words then how likely is that whatever  generates will be close to what you imagine and even if you like what it comes up with this part of the job figuring out what you want was supposed to be performed by the  they mightve had a much better interpretation but youll never know if you just pick what  gave you personally i prefer a written description with a simple sketch if you have any specific composition or pose in mind no matter how bad the sketch is it tells me much more about your idea than a perfect rendering of ais interpretation your description is supposed to tell me what you want  as a middleman to tell me what it thinks you want is just a distraction i would find it helpful actually as not everybody can explain visual concepts well in words even designersartists i think that this is actually one of the possible ways  can help in briefings a bit like a moodboard not every  is against,0.9927,positive
AIart,i wanna get either an ipad or a tablet for  complete beginner which would you recommend  im on day two with my ipad pro and i havent drawn much so a complete beginner drawer all around the ipad pro comes with an app called freeform and there arent many pencils to choose from but i did the adobe bundle for different apps a bit extreme considering im a beginner but all or nothing apparently ive done two drawings on adobe fresco and im loving it so much i did talk to a coworker today though and she suggested pro create and that was but i havent bought that to see how it works so i cant give my opinion on that and i also bought an apple pencil so its a bit easier to draw hope this helps tablet first because its cheaper to see if you like  you can buy a brand new th gen ipad for at best buy here in the us and an apple pencil for less if you get a refurbished one procreate is the go to  choice for digital  for so many reasons and for a one time purchase you get a well defined  that has gotten so many years of support all other apps seem janky or tacky in comparison i have used ipads and procreate for digital  for many years for professional use for previous jobs teaching and now as a tattoo  so you can get everything you need for less than i have a tab s i love it the spen uses the same pen tech as wacom and is fairly comfortable i got mine refurbished in basically new condition for after getting a case screen protector a pack of nibs and an sd card to expand the memory i think i spent around android has a host of free  apps including krita which is just a tablet version of the desktop app i use concepts for rough  and noodling it has a subscription but i like the basic brushes and they give you all of the copic color range so the free version is more than enough for me someone else mentioned ibispaint and i second that its a fantastic little app with everything you need to test out digital  an intuitive interface and the ability to record your process im a digital beginner too and i use the ipad pro along with procreate that is a one time purchase absolutely recommend them also adobe fresco has the option of using vectorial pencils its free no need to buy its subscription for ipad and iphone the best app is paper by wetransfer much simpler to use than procreate has one layer only so it is like  on real paper the wellknown  david hockney uses it i pad at walmart right now you can get an ipad th gen for the apple pencil for procreate is the app for digital  theres a reason its the number app in the ipad app store and the number choice for many artists who do  on an ipad there are a lot of other options out there but procreate just gives you so much for your money your ipad pro needs procreate they are meant for each other theres a reason apple features procreate constantly in their keynotes theres tons of tutorials on youtube for people of all skill levels to use procreate its really not hard to learn if youre looking for a beginner app i definitely recommend ibispaint x i have been using it for years and definitely recommend it for beginners and long term  id probably be using it for reading as well mostly basic stuff youtube writing reading etc im looking mostly for a tabletipad to carry it around since im sitting all day for work id like it to go somewhere in the house and just lay down with it lol i mentioned  in the post because i do want it to practice and maybe get into a  habit but ill also look into this tablet and apps mentioned in the comments thank you pro create now makes sense lol tysm i think it is overrated sure for single purchase it is fine but i dont understand the almost cult like hype around it it is basic and fine but i havent touched it in almost years looking at my app usage i dont think everyone needs procreate get the free trial and if you like it sure but it really isnt the goat everyone acts like it is i almost always expect comments like this when people ask for beginner help and it is kind of sad there are so few critiques of the actual glaring issues it has again for the price it is fine but it is nothing to write home about,0.9993,positive
AIart,how to know if its a scam as an  im a d digital artisti worked in nfts before i had positive experiences but this time i received an email from an nft project owner who found my artstation account and wishes to buy some if my artworks at a good price the email looks human and not robotic but i would like to know the signs of a fake email and what are the risks of accepting such offer if it turns out to be a scam please help any advice would be appreciated the nft itself is a scam thats a scam concept  here i receive mails like that every day possibilities they will send you a link and you have to click on it to create your nft but the website requires you to pay fees to generate this nft but dont worry the buyer will give you a bonus for those fees but the website is a scam and will steal your bank information or they will ask for your bank informations to pay you but thats a scam keep in mind that nft are now pure scam they look human because theres a human behind them last week theres one sent to my email i responded telling them to write me a biden and trump romance fanfic and they wrote it in minutes i then blocked them after they asked if the nft deal is still on i get these every day theyre absolutely scams but in what way and for what purpose post the email here and just redact the personal info the whole thing is a scam people pushing nfts are scammers a friend of mine had an even deeper scam and this was in its early days not exactly through this but he was approached to help make nfts while their team would handle the marketing side he had the other person sign paperwork so there would be some legal agreement but it was likely not even their legal name he ended up working late at night for months making all these variations for this big set of artwork that would all be sold as a collection hes a professional  so this was very impressive work mind you my friend never gave the full details probably because he was ashamed but something was compromised along the way they paid him the eth they promised but it was almost instantly sent to another wallet then they basically said thats weird no idea why that happened and ghosted him my suspicion which i told my friend since he didnt know how this could have happened was that they tricked him into interacting with a malicious smart contract that requests unlimited spending permissions they might have requested him to verify their wallet by signing a transaction that is actually an authorization to transfer funds metamask prompts the user to sign the transaction but if they dont understand the implications they might unknowingly authorize the transfer otherwise they may have created a fake nft marketplace or sent links that prompted him to enter their seed phrase or private keys he insisted he never clicked any links from them though which is why im more suspicious it would be the former he reported to the fbi with no avail and it was not a small amount at loss here anyway im just sharing this because it can potentially seem trustworthy but some people are really good at social engineering and shit you may be a lot more gullible than you think and like my friend you might think youre covering your bases with things like a legal contract when youre really not likely  its easy enough to hook up a  to email and give it instructions to try to get you to agree to an nft deal at best its a human  to do this en masse and watching their emails for replies they usually buy artworks as nfts i guess but i heard there exist some scammers that just steal your artworks and never pay for them i wanted to know how to define these scammers from an actual real nft project owner yeah i know i specifically asked the guy to use chatgpt for the fanfic lmao nfts are almost all scams i guess you need to ask how much they are offering and of its enough and only send high  files once they pay edit below makes a good comment that there are still ways to scam even when they appear to pay no dont my friend was paid after doing a massive amount of work then had his funds mysteriously transferred to another wallet they will most certainly have done social engineering like tricking you into giving them your keys or otherwise infected you with malware or gotten you to click a fake link or had you agree to a smart contact you dont understand the name of the person who contacted you already is fake just like hugh michael jackman who emailed me via artstation earlier all they need is one gullible person to fall for their shit to get what they want thats a good point well put i edited my comment,0.8567,positive
AIart,i use a galaxy tab s ultra and am trying to get into digital  however all i ever see are ads for procreate shills for procreate brush packs for procreate videos for procreate etc in a world where an ipad procreate exist is a tab s and any android  app simply useless inferior junk  ngl procreate is over hyped i used it when it was one of the only options when the pencil first came out but after finding a few others then having the event better csp added i literally havent touched pro in maybe years it is a fine base product it is cheap and it compares to other programs with more for less but i mostly paint and it sucks for that dont let that make you feel a need for a different device it is bare bones has no layout options doesnt allow much brush editing and has layer restrictions just doesnt work for me and while im glad to have had it when it first came out i dont plan to use it any time soon not at all sketchbook is a very capable program and i wouldnt say its inferior to procreate in fact i have an ipad and i still use sketchbook there procreate owes its popularity to the snowball effect the more people use it the more popular it seems so thats what new users choose it doesnt mean its the best only that its good enough that people stop searching for anything else once they give it a try no you have plenty of apps like infinite painter way better than procreate ibis paint medibang artrage mostly to imitate  media excellent brush engine krita clip studio hipaint sketchbook rough animator for animation woah artflow i wouldnt change my samsung tab for an ipad ever besides the apple pencil feels horrible to draw with i got a tab s specifically to use clip studio paint on best  program ive ever used hands down and the s handles it fine most of the time it can be a little chunky when youre like me and use a lot of layers but at least the brush itself doesnt usually lag yes tab as a device is good but  wise is a bit limited when it comes to apps there are more options updates and support with ios  apps video editing music stuff and for creative even scultping zbrush is coming soon i have an ipad air only a beginner  many use the samsung galaxy tabs for their  you can use krita ibis paint medibang all are free csp is a subscription you already had a galaxy tab try the free programs and a csp trial decide if you like them or not thats marketing you really push the into marketing your products shoving the junk into peoples faces so theyll buy it do your own research all for input from forums dont passively accept what marketing sells you ipads are a lot better but android can certainly get the job done its like i would suggest wacom over huion but huion can still make  it mostly depends on the user but having good tools helps i love infinite painter i found it pretty easy to learn this helped thanks unless something has changed in the last year or two though it doesnt support downloading brushes like procreate does and thats the main drawback this actually did change you can now importexport brushes as a part of the premium bundle features thank you i would say csp too i use it on windows and the only reason i havent considered it on android is that from what i understand its subscription instead of one time purchase no prob sounds like you have found programs that work for you dont fall for the fomo i think it is sort of the portable photoshop at this point in terms of availabilitypopularity so a lot of youtube artists use it for tutorials because their followers also have it what sort of  do you mainly do as a semi realism painter i know im not the target audience for procreate i think it is more for cartoon and such it really relies a lot on blend tools and i hate themnever use them so  on it is miserable xd,0.9986,positive

AIart,would like some help with choosing a  tablet im looking for a  tablet to get into the digital  space im not exactly sure what i want to do but probably mostly  and concept  i have found a few deals on some different products and would like some advice on how to approach my decision ipad th generation not my first choice because it does not have a laminated screen and im not sure how much i love apple products i use windows a lot ipad air m chip newest ipad air which looks really nice to draw on usually like but again im not sure i want to spend on a tablet i cant use photoshop or other pc  on still seems like a good deal but i would also have to buy the stupid pencil xp pen pro this thing honestly looks awesome its the cheapest large  tablet ive seen that had k resolution that being said inches is huge and i dont know how using a tablet that big would be ive never drawn or done  on a  that large huion kamvas plus this honestly looks like a huge steal to me its p which i worry about for a inch screen but with my other option being the xp pen pro im not sure if im willing to pay an extra as im a noob  magic  pad only thing i gathered was that it had more pressure levels than the other options k versus most tablets had k i would appreciate anyones input on my situation especially those with more experience with  tablets than i have i have a th gen ipad and my biggest gripe is battery life and memory space i havent run out of memory yet but without being able to add an sd card im worried i will but  on it is nice and i love being able to take it with me i use procreate and really like the touch functions if you dont mind being stuck to a computer i like artisul tablets i have a d and love it theyre on sale right now too so theyre around for the higher end ones and for a d no touch functions but having programmable hot keys is nice i use clip studio paint on this one they also offer cheap pen tablets if you dont mind not having a display personally i prefer a display but there are some amazing artists that just use pen tablets hi i am the mod of rdrawingtablet maybe this buying guide i put together may help httpsdocsthesevenpenscomdrawtabbuyingadrawingtablethttpsdocsthesevenpenscomdrawtabbuyingadrawingtablet feel free to drop by there if you have questions i have not used most of these i mostly use a cintiq and an old ipad like the st one my main recommendation would be to try to test them out in person before making a choice some things to look for latency does the line lag behind your pen when  an unsmoothed or lightly smoothed line that can be frustrating and even cause nausea for some people parallax when  is there a noticeable gap between your pen and your  this can result in precision problems especially on a large tablet when  near the edges of the active  area if most of your screen real estate is ui this may be less of a concern but still relevant i know you are leaning away from the ipads partly because you cant use photoshop i use photoshop professionally and i also have procreate on my ipad unless you are lettering comics procreate can do pretty much all of the things you would need from photoshop and it is a one time cost vs a monthly fee that locks you into a year at a time you cannot quit any time with adobe although the monthly charge can fool you into thinking so plus there are a lot of fun brushes being made for procreate that arent necessarily available for photoshop if you are specifically doing manga clip studio paint is also a good choice not as flexible as the other two but very good for its niche the ipad is slippery but you can buy screen protectors on amazon for that give you the paper feel and is hard to beat i have an xp pen  pro that works really well it doesnt have the highest  materials but also costs half of a cintiq its been years of constant use and has very few scratches on the screen for the price i think the xp pen tablets are excellent hey i draw on my free time and i bought xxppen pro for its really great i think the only issue is the size of the screen which might be too small for some people but its not my case hi im just looking for tablet recommendations and found your post here question where did you find the xp pen pro for its a huge deal im looking around for black friday deals and the cheapest i can find is how are the artisul pens and do you notice any differences between  on your ipad vs your display tablet hm i may go with the ipad then question then is if i want to opt for an ipad vs an ipad air i might go to an apple store and see the differences for myself in person how do you like the cintiq i found one used for but im under the assumption cintiq overprices their products a lot also how is the size also is procreate good  to make thumbnails and that sort of thing on how much photo editing does it offer or is it just purely drawingpainting what screen size do you use all the deals i found on facebook marketplace in my area i like the artisul pens they have buttons you can program as well but i dont really use them biggest difference is the touch commands from the ipad i dont have those on the tablet so being able to undo or rotate or zoom all has to be done manually vs just using gestures like on ipad also the ipad has less layers per file due to smaller memory the bigger your starting  the less layers you get to work with so if you were going to go for an ipad i would try to make sure you got one with more memory but  on them feels the same again minus the touch screen functions i like the cintique the resolution could be higher but the screen is big enough to make up for that it would be fun if it was bigger but i dont really need it to be bigger there is no perceptable latency or parallax i do strongly recommend that you get the adjustable stand that attaches on the back i use a lot of keyboard shortcuts so i miss the builtin buttons on the old wacom tablet i have some on the contextual menu that i can pull up with a click on the pen button so thats nice ive not used procreate for photo manipulation but i doubt that it has any robust tools its primarily a  program i recommend watching a lot of videos on it because the tools arent as intuitive for a pc user i didnt know all of the gestures so there are tools that were hidden to me it is much easier to use for vector  than photoshop imo and it has some naturalistic  tools that are way better than photoshop i still mainly use photoshop because it is part of a workflow that would be hard to change and the font library saves me a lot of money and hassle plus my license also gets me indesign and acrobat pro but i still consider switching to procreate sometimes the ipad is much more portable and if i had to i could still do my weekly comic on it it would just take longer inches its a decent size if youre starting digital  i mostly work in a size which fits almost real print size on the screen but also did some bigger works with no problems imo big screens are more useful for professionals than beginners inches its too small for a regular  tablet they are usually smaller

AIart,need  tablet advice so ive owned the apple ipad air inch th generation with the nd generation apple pencil i initially got it for notetaking but then started getting into  on the procreate app since im still basically a complete beginner is there any pads you guys would recommend under usd or should i just stick to what im using for a bit im interested in getting serious about  but dont wanna buy something thats maybe not worth it for me ty this is a great ipad for  you dont need anything else maybe with time youll want to upgrade to something larger but for now its not really worth it just keep practicing and see where this journey takes you thats the one ive got youre very lucky youve just got into  and you already have a superb tablet and pencil to use no need for anything bigger or better until your  demands it what you have is fine until you get better thats a pretty good ipad for what youre using it for the ipad is great unless you really needwant to use full computer apps or need a larger screen once you get into regular computer pen tablets and displays things get harder to use and less convenient compared to the ipad if you were to upgrade anything i would say get an ipad pro that also works with your nd gen pencil as others have said the ipad is a great it has a lot of great apps to use my personal favorites are procreate and fresco though fresco is annoying in that you have to have a yearly subscription and it only gives you gigs of cloud storage that it uses for everything so it fills up quick if you are looking for a lager  feel and you want to use more robust programs i would suggest going for something like the huion kamvas plus its an excellent price for value purchase and rebelle pro you get amazing water color effects as well as metallic paints with the pro version but the regular version is really good too but for for the pro you cant go wrong since you are willing to spend getting the  monitor i mentioned and the program will run you under there are other newer ones coming out for the monitor but what i wanted was etched glass so i didnt have to replace film when they wore down full laminated screen and good construction the kamvas plus is all of that plus is pretty affordable do your research there is a lot of info out there i have had a great experience with the wacom one for only like as a complete beginner this is a screenless  tablet for the pc the kind of paper like traction feels alot more natural than any tablet with a screen i use krita for  because im cheap and also just a beginner d httpskritaorgdehttpskritaorgde dont know if this is the kind of thing you are looking for but it got me after starting out on my android tablet with sketchbook the medium one is arround which feels quite nice and is flexible enough to switch between using and not using procreate is wonderful and i think your ipad is fine the trick is learning to do lots of layers so that if you mess up you can delete the mistake layer without messing up the rest ive illustrated books with it get one of the  cases that give you ample flat surface to glide the forearm and draw with the whole arm instead of just the wrist you dont need high end tech to get serious tbh i recommend you to keep using what you have tillit breaks or till you hit a point of it being extremely inconvenient to not upgrade it just use a free  like ibis paint on it and if after a year youre still regularly making  and still feel like you want an upgrade go for something bigger but honestly what you have is more than enough for programs with more utilities like csp i would recommed an affordable display tablet like xppen  or just make sure you have a competent pc nothing fancy unless you are doing vtuber  which takes like layers and stuff i suggest xppen i use krita on it and it works great or get the newest ipad pro inch and the new ipad pro pen drools over the pen really though thats the only reason i would upgrade is because of the pen ill definitely look into this thank you yes im trying to get better with layers right now actually haha i wasnt using them for a good while until now and thank you,0.9996,positive
AIart,to digital artists what are the best devices to use to create digital  im not a millionaire so i cant go for the most expensive i want to use procreate or ibispaintx with a digital pen but dont know whats best or what to buy i was thinking of a flip touchscreen laptop thats good to use for  aswell as other things but a tabletipad is fine aswell i appreciate any answers procreate ipad find one that fits ur budget i make digital drawings just for fun i use a wacom with a laptop and paint tool sai i have friends who make commissions with that too i think its the cheapest option and it works well if you already have a computer in my opinion look for something like an ipad th gen which goes for its standalone it works well enough and youre not out a lot of money you dont want to be like the people who end up pawning or selling their items later in the year because they wanted a dopamine hit of buying an expensive toy only to realize they didnt need a wacom since they only do  every few months look at craigslist a few months after tax return season not to mention the ipad isnt strictly a productivity tool you can do other things on it it is honestly whatever you could get your hand on ipad mini is a good one lots of ppl say the promotion is important i been  on ipad pro for four years now and i just traded my moms mini cranked another major piece last night and cant really tell a difference for  refresh rate is like halved but not like i paint strokes per second i use ibispaint x pretty good if youre fine with ads i also use krita would highly recommend it as its completely free and has animation features if thats something youre interested in however its a lot more complex then procreate or ibis and also doesnt have pen pressure for touchscreen only tablet as far as i know i have a wacom intuos s around usd so keep that in mind if pen pressure is something you use a lot as for the actual device i use an acer chromebook and have used it for  and school for around years i use a ipad not a touchscreen laptop you would use a laptop or pc with a wacom or huion i use the ipad air got it used dirt cheap and works well with procreate apple pencil and paper texture screen protector important to know that procreate only works with the ipad and works best if you also have the apple pencil its a great program but because of its exclusivity it can be expensive to get set up its also important to consider pressure sensitivity most digital  programs are designed to work with a device that can tell how hard or soft youre pressing however a lot of standard tablet styluses do not have this capability you may need a classic pen tablet wacom or other brand if you decide to go with a mac or pc laptop ipad and procreate with an apple pencil was a game changer for me im not sure about the differences between ipads because ive only ever owned my inch ipad pro procreate was just a lot more intuitive and easy to get a mental grasp of than clip studio was with procreate dreams being out i am even happier with my decision to switch to ipad and procreate i use huion kamvas tablet monitor tbh i recommend it a lot for me it was very affordable compared with other tablets despite all the things it has i saw it for ud on amazon you can buy it from the official website too but if u dont want to spend or dont have much money another option i recommend is the wacom intuos which is dollars u just need to download the drivers on ur pclaptop and connect the tablet ipad i cant make much recommendations as for devices since i draw with a mouse but as for  if you end up using a laptop or a  tablet that connects to a laptop i suggest going with firealpaca its free what ipads do you recommend best for it hey so you should look into the ipad air that has the second generation apple pencil also you can take a look at refurbished items or look for some used one on facebook market hope this helps,0.9994,positive
AIart,brush lagging issue across all softwares hi guys i thought this would be the best group to ask i have suddenly developed a brush lagging issue across every   i have including photoshop krita and paint tool sai i cannot for the life of me figure out whats causing it and it is making  nearly impossible its not my tablet or an underpowered pc i used the same set up throughout college with absolutely no issues wacom cintiq with an additional monitor off my laptop with its screen in use as well i normally only run the  im using pureref spotify and maybe a chrome window i have experienced none of these issues beforehand even with large file and brush sizes i checked to see if my boyfriends less powerful laptop had a similar reaction and it did but to a much less significant degree so much so that i think the filebrush was too large for his device and not anything else i have seen in task manager that a ton of ram is being eaten up but i cant figure out what from it doesnt look like im running anything nonessential or different than before thanks so much for any insight i love seeing all the different works in here this might not be the issue but who knows i had a wacom intuos pro and it was having cursor issues all over the place turns out it was because i also had my apple watch charger too close near by and the magnet on the charger was messing with the tablet what operating system are you using if you give some more info maybe someone can help what are your specs how long ago was it working properly are you sure there werent any background processes like virus scans or windows updates or something like that using resources i can honestly imagine most laptops that have or of the apps you listed running and especially a second monitor running at a high dpi would have performance issues what  i know xp pen released a patch that worked for me any  can cause what is called a memory leak as in which some data remains in ram even though it should be removed after calculation can be caused by a patch yet as you dont see the memory hog in the task manager it usually speak for some background process in windows or some malware another issue can be some stuff with the virtual memory or page file where windows puts stuff it has to remove from memory but wants to keep so it loads it off into that file quickly reaching some huge sizes you might want to check if some hdd is running with high access rates too when you experience the memory shortage windows i have a ryzen hs with a geforce i have gb of ram it was working properly earlier this month task manager does not show anything out of the ordinary as far as over strenuous proccesses is there any where to discern where the leak may be coming from if you push ctrl shift esc you will be able to see your ram usage this might help you identify whats using your ram there however could be something else causing your problem such as a virus or over full hard drive ect the best way to sort any problem there might be out is to do a system restore but this must not be done in a rush you first backup anything that needs backing up and make sure you have the drivers for any devices such as your  pad as depending which option you choose you might need to reinstall them i have not done it for a while but there should be an option to keep your files and just clean the registry windows often has all the drivers you need anyway its not difficult doing a system restore but backup your important files anyway this will reset your os to a new state and hopefully stop the lagging dang thats a pretty nice laptop specs arent the problem ive had to uninstall my wacom  and then reinstall it in the past because of a similar problem using blender aside from reinstalling the pen drivers the only other advice i can give is to save all your work shut down everything and launch the apps one at a time make sure it works and then try the next one i do know that mine acts crazy when the battery is getting low but it sounds like you probably have more experience with wacom stuff than i do sorry i couldnt be of more help good luck you should be able to see how the memory usage is slowly and increasingly growing usually leading to a lock up or crash at some point in the task manager but if a process not shown in it is the actual culprit it becomes harder microsoft offers rammap to explore the issue further httpslearnmicrosoftcomdedesysinternalsdownloadsrammaphttpslearnmicrosoftcomdedesysinternalsdownloadsrammap,0.9928,positive
AIart,does my  look soulless i have gotten a few comments that my  looks soulless and like  is this true does my  lack soul if so do you have any suggestions on how i can fix it i would love some feedback i am trying to take my  more seriously trying to get it sold have exhibitions and being more present on social media but this thought is sort of eating away at my confidence is my  that bad they look like something youd see on adult swim when youd wake up at am and have no clue what planet youre on i dont think its soulless but the collaging of different subjects with different lighting does make everything look flat on the whole in some images i imagine thats whats jumping out at your critics no because it has consumed the souls of all who have gazed upon it you definitely have a  and itll not appease to everyone though number and are amazing and more of an expected kind of  that i think most people would accept better and enjoy it definitely has soul and is not at all comparable to  stuff just keep going as with all artists youll have some good pieces some not so good some really bad and some amazing ones its the sharpness of lines and everything being in focus yes but in a good way i feel it has a loneliness to it or an otherworldly feel that could be interpreted as soulless maybe but i like it feels like im looking through a different lense of reality they remind me of things when we taught photoshop in my photography class we had to splice together at least pictures the other thing old flash games on newgrounds this is not a dig people worked hard on those gamevideo atmospheres like exmortis either way very nostalgic  it doesnt look soulless to me but as far as crafting goes there are a few pieces that feel more thoughtful than others it looks like youve been working on this  for a while just keep going keep enjoying youll find your audience you should look up if you havent already the original photoshop artists they werent using computer programs to do their splicing so it adds a bit more life to the piece good luck fellow  looks like sheogorath might enjoy jt i dont think theyre soulless or look like  but i can see why some people might see it that way i wouldnt take them too seriously though just keep at it taking each piece individually these are my opinions the perspective leads the eye through the image discovering new details and the racoon and pyramids are a surreal and unexpected backdrop its not my kind of thing but it is interesting this feels very much like the sort of thing glossy magaziness would publish as an  i would not be surprised if i came across it in national geographic for example i think that might be why someone might see it as soulless it feels commercial blow this up to m and it will look really good on a wall especially as part of a series in this  definitely not soulless imo could do with the background being a little darker for more contrast but thats just me this feels the most like  in that the elements dont seem to come together into a coherent whole at least for me like the perspective leads the eye through though i dont think the execution is quite as successful one of the other comments mentioned taking more care with the lighting and blending of the elements these styles of picture work best if it feels all the elements are in the same space and lightingcontrast helps with that this is great it feels like poster  especially like something from the polish school it would look entirely in place as the poster for something like an indie film festival with the title and dates in the lower right corner i think this is another one which people might read as aigenerated but to me it feels like something youd see in a car magazine from the s advertising a new model of rv again it feels commercial and not in the artistic way of another one with a bit of a poster  vibe for me its a little busy too much detail and too little contrast it ends up being a bit confusing but i dig the basic idea this is another good one it has the perspective it has the surrealism it has a coherent colour palette it has a vibe it feels like theres a story in there shades of terry gilliam this and are the two i could most see framed in an exhibition or on my wall needs company a series maybe some of those comments will be useful but remember its your  and the most important thing is that it works for you i dont know how much other  youve looked at but you might want to take a look at some of the things ive mentioned good luck yes the good kind what no youve got quite a unique  just carry on for a lot of people surreal  is automatically considered bad  is usually very unintentionally surreal so according to that group your stuff and  shares the same flaw in terms of plausibility that  could have  these images im going to call that a zero these are very clearly collages and im pretty sure  is even worse at making an image that looks convincingly like a collage than it is at other types of  the racoon ate my soul personally its not for me,0.9995,positive
AIart,is stolen   the only thing i dont like is when people try to pass off  as something they made how insecure do you have to be ironic how  was supposed to take over physical labor leaving people time to pursue creative hobbies now thats proven to be difficult so  is taking over our creative hobbies first  isnt even that good anyways it lacks the pizzaz of humanmade  trying not to take a side here but its interesting how different people attribute different amounts of humanity to a  model just in this discussion  is simultaneously not human enough to make real  but human enough to steal  is not  the human mind creates the  not only the technique but also the practice the creative thinking the mental process however powerful an  may be it will not be able to achieve this id like to think  is whatever emotionally touches you if someone uses  a tool to generate an impressionistic picture with awesome colors that reminded me of a time when i was a kid playing in the park then thats  a all  is stolen b i dont think  is really making  nor capable of it its just pictures  on the other hand is a product of our uniquely human condition it exists in the conceptual space in between a makers gesture and the viewers encounter duchamp taught us all this in it has nothing to do with the  of actual marks on a given surface which are only incidental to the above mentioned communicationresonance of our respective human experience everybodys saying all  is stolen and im not sure if people are really dumb enough to make a comparison like that or if everyone is intentionally saying it in order to actually im not sure youre probably just dumb an  who also knows how to code should make their own    and then ask a bunch of other artists to put their  into the  and use the  only within the  community for idea generation kon  is just the new dadaism or pop  look up marcel duchamp jasper johns or roy lichtensteinthey received the same criticisms as  today i feel like its a reflection of modern times and a product of a consumer culture run amuck do i like  not really do i think its stealing in most cases no no more so than a lot of popular  movements in the past i do find it interesting and i appreciate the conversations it creates also i think as  is developed there will be artists who step out from the flood of loweffort trash to define the emerging  love the design of this wolf,-0.6694,negative

AIart,is theft me digital  looks cool could you share the prompts if it makes you feel any better  is about to replace a whole bunch of peoples jobs not just artists there will always be a strong market for  skills like oils water color etc but this could be worrying for digital artists concept artists come to mind especially feed an  a bunch of keywords and stylistic references and itll spit out a million comps in a few minutes starting the timer until comments on this thread are locked im a d animator and designer and  just kills me the other day i saw this really cool d render online hundreds of likes and comments on their whole insta page with a decent following id asked the  what d  they use oh i dont use any this is all done by an  the post had over a thousand likes and here i am struggling to get and honestly at first glance i wouldnt of known it was  but then the shadows didnt make sense objects were a few inches off the ground etc the more i studied it  pisses me off and it does make me a bit nervous for what it will look like in the next few years to come deleted its a very impressive technology with lot of implications but what i hate is how people spam everywhere with it the previous generation of the nns was producing really flawed pictures and they were still appearing everywhere no effort involved just push a button and get images and now the  is on another level it could be a cool tool and theres some clever applications like filling in the space object removal etc but most people use it in the wrong way i still think it lacks consistency and understanding in what its doing so it cant yet produce a comic thats interesting or a concept  set for a movie or a game it can however generate some baseline ideas which an  could improve upon the images produced are not exactly theft as nn still composes a new concept but it has absorbed the creativity of thousands of artists whore images were used during training so does it really create something by itself i dunno its the same with code sometimes copilot spews out utter garbage or even chunks of someones code i prefer to do it manually to not let some crap creep into the code but that could change soon too its also really really creepy im only only thing ive wanted to do for a living is  all my motivation to do so is pretty much gone thanks to  this is not ais fault this is capitalisms fault its always capitalisms fault the everyman latches on to it cause yay i can generate  too but in true capitalist fashion we all know how this is going to turn out it will get to a point where it gets really good theyll license it out to companies to generate concept  the concept artists will be screwed out of proper paid which is already an issue and the everyman will be priced out of using the good ones deleted as an illustrator i understand the fear of  and yeah there are parts of it that feel like theft but all that aside you should probably take some time to make an actual great  to hammer home the point this one sort of sucks line weight in the skull is off the typography is very blah and in general it feels like not much time or care was taken to make this ans the  reflects that in the end  will replace lots of artists mostly the ones that arent very good,0.9963,positive

AIart,human  speaking i know all of you must be sick of hearing artists protesting against  but i would like to offer you my perspective as an  this isnt about hate or being condescending i know not everything is black and white not one side is perfect and not one side is evil allow me to give you my two cents and explain why  is harmful to the  industry im a year old  ive been  since before i can remember i was always extremely dedicated to it and always sought to tell big stories and create beautiful things with my  all throughout school i poured my heart into every  class i spend most of my days  and sharing the things i created with others now im old enough to get my foot in the door and find a career path im passionate about maybe even reach one of my overly ambitious dreams of working for a game studio like nintendo then with the popularity of  starting to come around im watching all my dreams crumble right in front of me and i know millions of other artists are feeling the same way i dont want to talk much about  theft because you all know that argument while it could be argued to be  theft its more of an unethical use of a private property and no feeding  into an   is not the same as humans taking inspiration from other artists while we look at someone elses work something in nature a person a building an object how we put that into our work incorporates the human experience into the  its what makes it come alive and gives it meaning and makes it unique  doesnt hold the same weight whether its due to an inconsistent  or absurd anatomy or just the complete lack of human experience and interpretation if you ask an  what inspired them they will tell you an  they look up to or something in nature theyve seen if you ask an  where it got its ideas it wont tell you anything its  if you ask the company behind it theyll give a loose and uninspired answer the two things are very different if you say  doesnt directly copy and paste work neither do  the  world has just gotten more competitive there are no shortage of artists in the world and yet we are constantly struggling to find jobs and make ends meet we are all scraping by while we try desperately to land ourselves in a well paying career that treats us like human beings and not tireless machines some of us survive on  work with  coming into play what is there left for  no i dont believe it will completely negate  as a whole however why would studios hire artists when they can pay only a few dollars for fully rendered illustrations of what they might want why would they hire concept artists and now why would the general public want to pay hundreds of dollars to get a high  piece of  when they can just give a couple bucks to an   to come up with dozens of pieces this is utterly destroying our livelihood i can argue all day about how human  is better than  in these instances but i wont because youve heard it before and its not the point the point is that real human beings are being cheated out of jobs they are viscerally passionate for by  it has grown tens of times more challenging to get commissions this holiday season suddenly im terrified im not going to afford to celebrate the holidays with my family or an important vet visit for my kitten when just a few months ago this wasnt an issue there is no shortage of artists in the world who are willing and eager to accept these jobs so why are we creating artificial ones i must admit i have seen some fun creations made from  its fun to create silly images that wouldnt otherwise exist whether its funny or scary or cool but please dont let this replace  while i can understand both sides of  is real  versus  is not real  nobody can give a definitive answer just like every other time the definition of  was challenged throughout history i dont want to get into the argument whether  and  artists can thrive side by side i think you can figure out what i think about that i do think its ironic how many scifi books and movies have predicted this sort of thing happening and yet we do it anyways i could go on all day about this but i think this is enough im not saying to completely stop  or to stop having fun with it just think twice before you try to profit off of it and think of an impact it has on millions of other people just trying to navigate through their lives thanks for reading edit some common things ive noticed i do not believe that i am special and i dont believe the world owes me anything i do what i love because i love to do it and im going to do it no matter whether im getting paid my main point here is that  is a career that has always at any point in history has been extremely challenging to make any money off of and  is going to make it even harder for  to make money after having  be a viable source of income for some time it suddenly feels like ive been laid off all i ask is for those profiting off of  that is built on stolen  to reconsider and think about the millions of lives they are affecting im not saying any other fields are not being affected by  yes every field is going to be impacted eventually i dont have to speak on behalf of every field because i am not in those fields and i am not a professional in any one of those fields i have experience of being in the  field and knowing that creatives are some of the most underappreciated people throughout all of history this is a matter i am passionate about though im sure you can tell i have very strong opinions i am trying to be as neutral as i possibly can and try to see your side of things as well even if i dont come off that way im not going to adopt  into my craft at least not right now using assets like this feels to me personally like im cheating if i use a d model in my digital  program i feel like ive cheated or copied unless i made the model if i incorporate a photograph into my work i feel like im stealing unless i took the picture this is not just making things harder for myself it is my artistic process and i am happy with the way i do things it is my process and sure it might not be perfect and it may take longer but i am happy with crafting as much as i can with my own hands do not tell artists to just embrace it if they simply do not want to utilize it the way i chose to compete against this new wave of  is continue to improve upon what is important to me if you are a human  and chose to incorporate  into your work that is fine that is your process not mine,0.9992,positive

art,i honestly dont get how warhol was an   i dont see why not he worked all day and all night for most of his life creating then later producing artwork the only drug he ever took was a mild dosage of speed so he could stay up and work very much a workaholic his body couldnt handle anything more than that though much of his later work was completely put together by others he spent all of his time devoted to his job if you look at the entire catalogue of his work you might find that he was insanely prolific and also a really good draftsman he had a very unique way of illustrating things he was also a great writer imo the aura that he created about himself being nothing andor a fake  was all done on purpose to show the world that everybody is an  one of the hallmarks of modern  is that its legitimacy rests more on the concept behind the piece than with the virtuosity of the  andy warhols  chooses popular icons as his subjects campbells soup marylin monroe chairman mao etc because these are artifacts of the landscape of the world we live in i think its this idea that makes warhols work artistically relevant and not just relevant but thoughtprovoking and original the repetitivenesshttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediaenfcampbells_soup_cans_momajpg and seeming triviality of the subjectshttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediaengreencocacolajpg that occurs as a result are just reflections of the world we live in which for warhol was a one where beauty was becoming a synthetic massproduced commodity honest question what is your definition of  and in what way does warhol fall short of this definition in my  history class the first piece we studied was a random rock that a prehistoric human had found on his journeys and brought home because it looked vaguely like a person they found it a far distance away from its origin so they knew it just didnt randomly move there it was purposefully taken another piece was a regular toilet bowlhttpenwikipediaorgwikifountain_duchamp which was so controversial that it ended up being censored for school groups placed behind a curtain the point is  is anything on a pedestal created or placed for no other reason than to be viewed this is incomplete practical things can be works of  too ornate swords and typewriters and buildings hell even as a programmer i see some code that is just beautiful but once you display it it is incontrivably  whether or not it is successful  has to do with your goals do you want to make something beautiful make money shock cause people to think to me the best  does more than one of these things by the way upvoted your submission because i discussing this though i may not agree with you i know everyone should just continue  portraits landscapes and still lifes i honestly dont get how tech nerds are incapable of reading about artwork they dont understand and then think their narrowly defined aesthetic taste andor ignorance is somehow interesting enough to share with the world warhols  has a lot to say the most obvious of which should be what it reveals about your preconceived notions of  it makes me think about life and my position in the world a lot more than an illuminated manuscript or some other easier  created with the sole purpose of worshipping a god or something  is an image and an idea modern and contemporary  skew more towards the idea whats wrong with that seriouslyhttpwwwkottkeorgthemostbeautifulsuicide there was obviously a fondness for the image you dont sound like much of an  nor one who can appreciate it lots of interesting commentary here myself i find it very difficult to find common ground between  and words it does occur to me that there must have been an enormous evolutionary advantage to being able to persuasively sketch in the dirt a compelling strategy for surrounding and approaching game or a strategy for finding food or shelter making images must run deep in our nature also didnt wittgenstein in tractatus assert that all thinking is visual in nature and didnt he also assert that human visualization underlies all language forgive me if this is offbase i find wittgenstein very challenging perhaps someone else can clarify in any case it seems to me that making  is as fundamental as speaking its odd that we would never assert that someone who was speaking was in fact not speaking yet people often feel that someone who is making  is in fact not doing so testhttpsgiphycomgifsreactionxlcrpieyrdzvwd the whole modernism movement is about breaking the rules thus you wont get it unless you get it or you are the  p anyway he liked to express the degrading effect of mass production that is having the same product available to everyone causes a loss of value weve become dull check out pyramids its nice if you ever get a chance read some of philosopher arthur dantos stuff on warhol it will change your entire perspective on  he said he was therefore he was just like when duchamp said his urinal was  it was  because he said it was neither of these mundane truths say anything at all about whether duchamps urinal was good  or whether warhol was a good  a shoe is food if you eat it that doesnt necessarily imply it is good as food the same goes for  you can eat a  if you want but why would you want to you can look at a urinal or a warhol if you want sure why not well because theyre boring thats why not theyre not good at doing what really good  is good at at least eating a shoe might keep you alive in an emergency bad  is the single most useless thing in the world well other than its

and give them some constructive criticism most of you hide in your own threads never daring to venture outside why we dont allow direct uploads httpsredditaugo what a garbage system with the amount of time i have to set up upload and prepare my  on here i could better spend that time honing my craft you should really rethink making people use a service like imgur which forces you to give up your phone number youre not doing artists any favours its also a terribly unstable service that isnt really built for artists man i just wanna share my  i dont postuse tumbler i draw on ibs paint and i dont want to make an account to just post  i think it doesnt make sense to have us uploading images on imgur i read the linked post and also commented this there memes wouldnt get upvoted anyway and should be flagged by community and filtered by the mods eventually anyone who wanted to post memes would learn that its pointless i dont know how much memes and shit posts rgd gets but theyre doing a pretty good job of filtering it with limited mods who probably also have more important things to do and they have more members i dont have experience with crossposting but how much harder is it to crosspost stuff from imgur i also dont see any reason why we shouldnt adopt new capabilities of a platform to simplify our lives maybe we should go back to  with fingers on cave walls too seeing the images on the feed is much much easier to see the stuff you like without having to click on every single post and it probably also helps moderate content eg the photo bashing policy to me it looks like the majority of the people you are hurting with this policy are the artists themselves who now have to jump through hoops and spend time uploading stuff on imgur and then link the image link here for exactly the same effect as just uploading directly if there was a different community on reddit for digital  critique that didnt have me jump through arbitrary hoops i would gladly go there dude i just want to post one  guys my post was deleted and there was nothing much not even in the title much less in the  itself i see hundreds of difficulties just to post a damn  why do you make it so difficult the site itself already has this image posting service that is annoying bro forgive any mistakes in my english its not my native language and im still learning with that much frills and absurd rules it only makes more people move away and lose interest in the community why make a simple  post so difficult seems like rule could use an update tumblr is pretty dead ever since being sanitized and artstation is a step above deviantart remove the extra imgur step its dumb pointless and wastes everyones time your argument about ireddit is flawed for reasons countless people have already explained and doesnt make all that much sense how to get the link from imgur in a tablet device that doesnt have a right click option ive been struggling to share my work here but the problem is getting the image from imgur linking from deviant  does not give a preview ok but what about us ibis paint users which image hosting is best for  when i view my uploaded image from imgur it makes the reso so small you cant see the detail how can someone critique if they cant see the actual image as intended what are some other less regulated groups i just wanna share my  work but every time i do theres one stipulation that will get me banned or blocked or downvoted im not on tumblr or deviantart etc i have work older than a year old that is dope and i want to share can you explain why did my post get removed you wrote link to the image is dead yet the image showed perfectly fine i just have a genuinely curios question i just want to understand whats the purpose of posting like this i wanted to start publishing my drawings here but after seeing the rules for this i changed my mind,0.9478,positive

AIart,can i draw from wrist ive been playing games from my wrist for years and i also like  from wrist but as i started to learn how to draw everybody keeps saying draw from elbow or your shoulder due to health issues and other benefits like  straight lines but my graphic tablet is so tiny i forced myself to get used to it and i cant draw like that because of my tablets size it is absurd and when i was  from wrist i feel more confident and draw way more better so can i draw from my wrist if i strecth my fingers and wrist regularly each part of the arm has different dynamics for fast straight lines use the elbow in a straight motion locking the hand for curves and organic shapes the wrist is the best since it moves in circular or wavy motions and use the fingers for fine detail and very controlled movements so yeah you can and should use the wrist i think you need to provide a video or photo of what you are actually doing so we can help as i have no idea what you mean draw from wrist i mean you can but im sure your wrist isnt going to thank you later there are times when you should use your wrist just like any other joint there are times when you just use your fingers it depends on what youre doing the trouble comes when you dont know what youre doing and youre not being kind to the parts that you depend on to be able to draw they will revolt on you if you abuse them so dont abuse them it really depends on what youre doing and the size of what youre  on it doesnt make sense to draw only from your elbow on a x tablet it makes it harder to maintain stability when  that tiny just like  from your wrist on a mxm  it does make easier to make longer straight lines instead of them curving around the wrist pivot but again this depends on tablet size its more applicable the larger the tablet gets the main thing is to make sure you dont end up causing injury due to repetitive stress like reaching too far or too close with your wristfingers you should pan a lot or move your actual hand around so you can always draw in a comfortable range of motion for your fingers kinda like you move your hand around when you write instead of just planting it on the far edge of the page if you get a bigger tablet or draw on a pad then yeah its generally better to draw from your elbowshoulder as you have a far wider range of motion yes you can when it comes to injuries prevention just make sure to keep proper posture and remember to take occasional breaks when  for longer period of time i also draw on a small tablet but im more used to  from my shoulder because i mostly draw on a big paper before i started  digitally but instead of completely using my wrist i gently anchored the base of my palm so i could draw in a small motion while still using my shoulder it really comes down to what feels more natural to you i mean using wrist as a pivot httpsdesigntutspluscomarticlesdrawingfromtheshouldervsdrawingfromthewristprosandconscmshttpsdesigntutspluscomarticlesdrawingfromtheshouldervsdrawingfromthewristprosandconscms what ever method feels natural and not forced otherwise you can injure yourself,0.9971,positive

AIart,does anybody know of an app for practicing color matching i invision the app showing me an image and telling me to match a specific color with a procreate type color wheel ive been  for awhile and wanted to start  and know a little color theory but i would like an app i can use to practice whenever i have free time also since ive just started advice would be nice as well this is not exactly what you are looking for but the only thing i know in the direction youre asking about there is a mobile appgame called i love hue that scrambles a gradient of colored blocks and you attempt to recreate the original color gradient with as little swaps as you can as for any advice for color matching you are asking about digital  so you get to cheat a little bit the eyedropper tool is your best friend in this regard you can use it to pull colors from any reference image youd like to source your color palette from as an easy step if youre set on improving your color selection from scratch you can make your own color palettes with blending and mixing brushes on a throwaway layer then use the eyedropper to select your colors from the digital palette youve created to stay consistent throughout a work this one is fun httpscoolorscodaddedeefdebfdd in procreate you can drop the image into the color wheel and it will generate a swatch pallet base on the image then you pick which color you want to match and choose the swatch that you think is closest then paint on it to compare i am not entirely sure what you mean but this could also be done if you just practicing color matching i dont know if that has any help with color theory unless you look into hues and saturation sliders as well maybe this httpsappsapplecomusappcoloringmatchid,0.9938,positive

AIart,i have an year old  tablet is it worth upgrading so i have a wacom intuos pro m tablet from years ago which ive used sparingly recently ive been doing more and more stuff with the tablet however when it comes to the market i havent been paying attention to new tablets at all ever since i bought it originally and so now that im actually getting more usage out of it again it got me wondering how much had these tablets actually improved how much cheaper have they gotten might it be worth getting a new one because maybe todays cheapest models are better than this decent tablet from years ago so thats basically my question how much progress has been made since and what tablet would i need to buy today for it to be worth the upgrade unless you want to move onto a screen tablet im not a fan of them theres no reason to change the intuous pro m is the perfect tablet imo the only thing that sucks about it is when youre using it over bluetooth the lag is super annoying but thats bluetooths fault not wacoms when using it wired its just chefs kiss pen tablet technology has matured many years ago so if your wacom is still working theres not much reason to upgrade honestly the only reason why you should upgrade a tablet is if its falling apart thanks if i were to upgrade it would probably be to one with a built in display based on that are there any things to watch out for with those ones i have very little experience with newer screened tablets as i prefer non screened ones the tech on those has improved as far as screen  though the older screens use led while some of the newer ones use oled with oled you get much darker blacks and more overall brightness led ones are cheaper though and still the more prominent there are also new products that can be used as screened tablet when connected to a computer and an android tablet when not connected i have no experience with these at all however i do know that when these are used as an android tablet none of the pen functions like mapping buttons or pressure sensitivity can be adjusted still an interesting idea here are some features you should look for in pen displays before you buy httpsyoutubeezlcclehttpsyoutubeezlccle and if you need recommendations here are some ive reviewed last year httpswwwparkablogscomcontentpendisplayrecommendationshttpswwwparkablogscomcontentpendisplayrecommendations,0.9787,positive

AIart,tried  my crush from memory  i think its really beautiful i think you couldve had a little fun with light catching some of the red hair as red hair illuminates beautifully but that was just a thought its lovely reminds me of life is strange its a great job very accurate well done shes our crush now comrade i definitely see the influence of max in the lips and lower half of the face its hard to say if she looks like who you were going for without knowing but it stands well on its own she doesnt look disgusted imo i see a more hollow expression kinda like she spaced out looking at something and then didnt snap back to it something about the hair does feel slightly detached from her mainly at the base near the hairline and on the shadow side of her face i like all the color choices and shading individually and i think you did a good job with the lighting especially since it was a mix of references imagination thats always a lot harder to pin down lighting and not end up mixing different light sources awesome portrait as usual man that looks astounding did you have any formal training i started digital  few months ago and i see little progress she is very nice what a pity she lost her arms being so young ive went through your older posts and i absolutelly love your  its amazing also on some pieces i like the lighting on others face expression actually incredible i tried  someone without having any kind of direct reference because i dont have any lol i have no idea how similar this  actually is so any resemblance to real persons living or dead is purely coincidental im not sure im gonna show this to anyone but would still appreciate your feedback in particular how to improve it this must be the among the most challenging things i tried and trying to get the resemblance without any reference is probably the hardest thing i tried so far and i most probably failed obviously i used other references mostly relying on a shot of max mayfield from stranger things and katya sitak for the hair and changed things from there the lighting was really challenging and i realized i shouldve picked an easier light but it was too late getting the shadow color and brightness right is kind of hard also it came out too saturated and too red so i fixed it a bit in post i would also like to ask about her mouth and expression sometimes it seems to me she has a bit of a disgusted expression but im still not sure why exactly and how to fix it so if you have any suggestions please let me know i need a single strand of hair up front to unlock a forbidden memory thx lol you should send it to her not only are your  skills amazing its amazing that you remember what your crush looks like enough to draw her now its our crash op is it accurate it looks good really good but do you think its accurate just curious though it looks really good isnt this kinda wierd like some helgaarnold type shit youre just like  a bunch of your crush does she know i like what you did for the most part and the face is especially nice the few minor things i noticed that look a little off are the hair just below the earlobe is too forward towards the face as if the back of the ear doesnt exist the slightly lighter value for the hair going from the top of the ear toward the forehead looks a bit off same with just to the left of the ear and going down towards the neck those values look somewhat bright in the form shadow if theyre supposed to be bounced ambient light we should see its effect more consistently in the form shadow side the shoulders seem a bit too rounded and where the ends of the collarbones touch the deltoid muscles can use more definition the neck can use a bit of definition just a slight hint of the anatomical structure of the neck muscles,0.9988,positive

AIart,im new to digital  i tried this  because i suck at hyperrealism i keep trying though what do you think  if youre doing this as a hobby just for the amusement of it because lets just accept it  can be a lot of fun then just keep on trucking if you would really like to greatly improve your skills theres one thing i would like to emphasize we all suck when we start we continue to suck for a good long time afterwards though perhaps just a little bit less im glad you said you keep trying because the only way to improve is to keep at it that said unless you throw yourself into the forfun category which is perfectly fine realism is really hard to avoid not hyper realism mind you but rather attempting to reproduce the world around you as accurately as your skills allow which can lead to hyperrealism if we allow it though most of us tend to branch off and develop our own  thats where  really comes from you start learning how to draw the world around you and eventually you develop your own shortcuts and shorthand for describing that world in a way that reflects your own taste it takes a lot of time and sweat but if youd like to take this road try  from life or from photographs using reference will help you train your ability to observe and in turn will make you rewire the human brain which has over time evolved a natural tendency to simplify everything into rudimentary icons a mountain becomes a triangle a hill becomes a simple arc but there is far more to them than that this was made for new painters like you httpwwwredditcomrdigitalpaintingcommentsebwobbly_wednesday__the_how_to_get_started_edition i think hyperrealism is a fairly lofty target for any painter new or old still plenty of room for great  from every point between abstract and realism though so keep up the good stuff,0.9911,positive

AIart,digital  but  hey you silly goofballs i am a   who just recently got into digital  via a samsung tab s and i was wondering if theres an  program that matches the feel of   pen paper as thatd be seriously cool but all i get once i look it up is a bunch of sissies on reddit asking for advice on digital  and not my very niche and specific question rebelle is imo the closest but its still not quite it i am a   that transitioned to digital it took me quite some time to get used to it cca a year i use photoshop procreate and csp now deleted you can get close to having the feel of   with specific programs that claim to do as much but having it look like a   is mostly determined by your knowledge and skill with the program there are artists that can pull this trick off very successfully but all of them have said it comes down to technique and not the program my favorite artists that can do this are marco bucci tiffanie mang and the father of digital  craig mullins watch videos of them  and you might learn a few techniques better yet marco bucci has  instructional videos on his website that focus entirely on digital  like a  painter i have an s and this is a hardware hack but i put zfold tips in my spen pro and the feel of the pen on the screen went from me trying to get used to it to holy crap this is what its supposed to feel like unfortunately the zfold tips will not fit in the standard spen but its definitely worth getting the pro i got mine on ebay for cheap make sure the one you get has a zfold switch at the top you dont set it to zfold but the tips fit that one my honest tip is not to try and recreate a  look digitally theres no point to that might aswell just make a  piece at that point embrace the sleek look and tools that digital  programs offer already procreate but that isnt on samsung try clip studio you sir are cool thanks for the recommendation ill check it outn seconding realistic  studio even with my great realistic clip studio brushes sometimes i switch from it to ras because the feeling and simplicity just are right it may not have as many options for dpi and  size but i use it more for personal enjoyment of realism without the mess of oils unfortunately i could only find artrage on the google play store i have a s as well theres also something called artrage although i wasnt impressed by it that much edit and procreate is for the ipad only,0.9938,positive

AIart,is tracing  tutorials bad so here is a question on pintrest there is alot of  tutorials that ofc helps alot in digital drawings i use some them and trace them as to practice the creatordrawer is giving us info how to draw and helping us so is tracing the tutorials fine its perfectly fine to trace as long as its for practice however only tracing when learning to do  isnt really a good idea so id suggest maybe tracing once and then trying to draw it once or twice without tracing it wont be perfect but i find its easier to learn  when you allow yourself to try and fail and then reflect over what you did well and what could use some improvement you dont really get that chance with tracing perhaps it helps for handiwork but it doesnt really teach you what to draw the thing youre  as tracing does not exactly let you understand the shapes dimensions and most especially the relationship between elements of the subject being drawn it would be better to draw from life as in eyeball an object and try  it on your own this requires to establish why the object looks the way it does rather than just follow preexisting lines every  teacher ive followed whos actually a really good  recommend tracing for beginners i feel like tracing is totally fine for practice it helped me a lot in the past but thishttpsyoutubeabytnfegosiaiyvjzvfinjdo might be a better way to actually learn from other artists i personally found that video super helpful for my  practice i actually learned from tracing though i traced over anatomy and such i would then shade or color it the best i could to try and understand where the shadows and shapes were i honestly think tracing is such and underrated learning tactic im able to draw anatomy without a reference now but with one my hands sing its my favorite thing to do now as long as your not posting and trying to pass it off a your own its fine just remember to practice without tracing every once in a while herehttpsimgurcomaytejody is one of my earlier pieces where i got better and starting just tracing guides and  it on my own just using the guide it took me a long time to be able to eye and draw a proportional replica of guides and bodies so having an accurate base to start on even if the base was traced is a great way to learn the basics of where everything goes and how it should look youll be more easily able to spot mistakes in other pieces if you know and draw things that you know are accurately scaled in others dont let anyone stop you from learning by tracing i felt really embarrassed by doing it but now i dont care i learned that way its what ever helps you as long as you dont steal credit hope this helped its important to develop your personal process after u trace you should give it a try yourself but  isnt just the lines you see but the structure underneath i found youtube tutorials to be straight up unhelpful i have always learned more by  from multiple references of the same subject tracing isnt inherently bad the issue is a lot of people dont think about line construction or general structure and tend to just blindly copy which usually hamstrings them when they stop tracing you certainly dont learn as much if you trace i still find myself tracing at times just to become familiar with the basic shapes of certain things its perfectly fine for practice just remember trial and error is part of the journey of being an  i wouldnt rely on tracing for anything other than basic practice and even then i encourage you to challenge yourself and try and draw them without tracing tracing is fine as long as it is used to get the basics down and to understand the flow of stuff sometimes the only time its bad is if you try to pass off things as your own because you changed the color or clothing on the same base or something tracing your own work isnt bad though yes its fine for practice tracing anything but unedited photos is bad tracing only serves as a way to break down anatomy into basic shapes in order to be redrawn it has no use if the reference is styled dont try to learn everything at the same time i mean as long as you practice and consciously draw while thinking about what you are  its ok but just dont make it a habit ive done studies first tracting then copying then from memory maybe that ccan help this is the best video about tracing you will findhttpsyoutubefemjptgusipktqxgdesfbzs this is drew struzan famous movie poster  he not only explains why he traces but we can also see the context someone would use tracing to do in this case realistic  real fast because you work with deadlines if youre not on this scenario learn how to measure stuff by eye you still need this skill to work with tracing,0.9972,positive

AIart,best  tablet for beginner i plan on using infinite painter so now im looking for the best  tablet with screen that is compatible with this program ive read xp pen and huion are good any recommendations thanks everyone i ended up going with samsung so far the program works great on it and the pen is pretty responsive my only complaint is that i wish the battery life were better ill probably play around with some settings to see if that helps i use a samsung s fe and infinite painter works great with it want to know too i have huion so my huion suggestion would be biased but xp pen is awesome too i have the huion kamvas which is pretty nice and gets the job done the screen is a good size and the pen is decently responsive though i dont have a frame of reference with other graphics tablets i would say that the cable management for it is kinda a nightmare though so keep that in mind if you dont wanna have a bunch of wire clutter good to know samsung was my first thought but then i read about some cheaper tablets too many options even trying to compare all the galaxy tabs gets overwhelming lol,0.9942,positive

AIart,any other autisticsneurodivergents here how do you handle your  business i recently made this posthttpswwwredditcomrartbusinesssamqcolr on this sub asking how to shift my parents lifetime worth of paintings tldr of the post for the last years my parent has pretty much entirely given up on marketing of the paintings and we have literally hundreds sitting gathering dust at home im now wanting to shift them and most people in the comments on this post suggested that in person fairs or exhibitions or donating the paintings would be a better way than trying to sell online my problem im autistic and my social skills are pretty dire like no matter what i try to improve they may be better marginally but still not great my parent who makes the paintings is also autistic selling in person very much requires good communication and sales tactics which i literally do not have if i try and fake it it comes off as fake and everyone can tell even if im not faking my communication is never that great my parent comes across to people even worse than i do my question if any other autistics or neurodivergent people out there how do you handle this having to sell your work or network to people in person do you do everything onlinevia an agency man its so hard my strategy is to acknowledge people with a hello let me know if you have any questions and go back to  or sewing just let the work speak for itself i feel like that communicates you are free to browse im weird and awkward but also confident in my product i have only done a half dozen shows but i seem to do about as well as most people who have similar product maybe you can find a local person who could do the sales part for you for a cut not an  dealer theyre snobs but just a family friend whod like to make some money on the weekends if i was nearby id be down to help depending on the wuality of the work to some degree just a thought im autistic and i usually just give a small smile and head nod to acknowledge them or a simple hello never really had to make small talk if they want something theyll let you know didnt seem to be a factor in sales i think people expect weirdness from artists i have no chance or desire to do anything in person which is what every  business gurupersonality says to do  fairs in person sales whatever i take the complete opposite approach sell on ebay with zero interaction at all i learned how to talk to people by watching others that were skilled in that department and also talking with a therapist about how to talk to people literally going over scenarios with them i also did standup comedy for years but i dont think that route is for everyone i will say even selling online youll need to be able to express yourself in order to gain an audience and get eyes on your work but the key to this kind of sale is actually authenticity lean in to the fact that you dont know how to talk to people lean in to the fact that your parents has been making  for years tell that story were just autistic people trying to sell some paintings so we dont drown in them im also autistic and i relate completely when you talk about seeming like youre faking it while i havent tried selling in person yet my job requires a lot of similar social interactions and i now feel completely confident in most social situations including public speaking and interacting with people i havent met what freed me was just embracing the fact that im autistic im not sure but i feel its probably pretty obvious when people speek to me that im not socially normal however i feel i still get along with everyone and communicate information very well the trick is to just be extremely polite and patient with everyone no matter what attitude they bring or what you may be feeling at the time this should be easy if youre just genuinely a nice person who cares and i actually really enjoy social interactions in this way now dont worry about trying to fit in or seem normal in the slightest some people actually differently to others so what thats your selling point instead of hiding who you are let people know we tend to struggle with social anxiety hard i try to be direct and let them know when theyre in my booth light initial conversation a wave or a smile acknowledging people but not being over the top it helps my sales to be honest with who i am and my human struggles in fact they tend to open up and express their own feelings when i do we dont have to always like ourselves to let others see our genuine value its like a beacon and those people will flock to your booth if they know who you are and who your parents were its okay to be extra vulnerable when youre a creative because its almost expected to be a bit different build up the mania and manic energy until youre forced to be productive i do everything in bursts you could just start by listing them online you can post  for sale on facebook marketplace ebay and etsy if youre really stumped about what to write in the description you can always use chat  for ideas it is often much easier to sell in person but that can also be expensive and time consuming as you usually have to pay a fee to show your work at markets you would probably make more money with a regular job if finances are the main concern if you want to donate them you could also gift them for free on places like buy nothing or facebook marketplace another option is to look for charities who could sell them at auctions to raise money you could find a localish coffee shop that would allow the paintings to be displayed with price tags they could pay with venmo or whatever take the  and you could replace the  rinse and repeat i have major depression i have a big calendar with my deadline in a place where i have to see it often and when im  i keep myself entertained with youtube videos on interesting topics i always have a cup of my favourite tea and i take a nap before starting so i dont drop tired during working time tbh it takes a lot of practice to be patient with yourself on socializing and finding what works for you so try not to be hard on yourself for me im just naturally overly politereserved when meeting strangers so i lean onto that to save energy and avoid overthinking neurotypical peeps are usually good with a gentle smile and simple greeting which shows that youre a chill person who isnt going to breathe down their neck to sell them something the more you play into your strengths and personality the more genuine you present yourself as bc youre being honest and the more comfortable people will be around you even now i feel super drained after being around people but i dont feel as miserable about it because im not tryingas hard to hide who i am anymore again it takes monthsyears to practice being comfortable with socializing but its possible i was at an indoor fair last week selling my greeting cards and behind me was a gentleman selling his nonverbal artistic childs artwork looks like he did pretty good can you team up with someone who agrees to do the sales for you maybe take some photos of your parents artwork on your phone attend an  show talk to the presenters and exhibitors show them your photos and ask if they would be willing to sell for you for a reasonable cut of the profits not very well,0.9995,positive

AIart,having trouble getting started step prints hello feeling very overwhelmed started  since covid have a wall full of  ready to go its all stream of consciousness none of it planned i just do got a rebel t camera backdrop lamps and some memory cards but i am having so much trouble getting photos of my  to even start making prints it seems like it never crops perfectly and i always have to skew it in some way to get it to fit despite using grids over the camera display and trying to have everything be perfectly square on to the camera then i finally created an account on mpix and was horrified that they deduct an unknownsized border from my original maybe so that means i would need to add a border to all my photos just so i could then remove that border but websites that offer to add borders to your images use an arbitrary number like nondescript units and id have to guess at what mpix uses maddening makes my adhd brain crazy tried to switch to printique and they also have a nonnegotiable border maybe its only adding a border because my picture isnt perfectly x in pixels but how would i do that if im cropping from my raw photo im not sure thats it other things making me nuts and overwhelming my motivation using rawtherapee and seeing how many different variants of my own pictures there can be colorwise and none of them truly feeling authentic to the original i want what i made not some weird offshoot miscolor i havent even dealt with differences in printing color palettes versus what i get on the screen thats going to be a new nightmare anyway you can see some  in my post history i really want to start attending the local thursday street fests or the st friday  walks but i have to overcome this hurdle first ive seen many of you mention just working with your local print shop for whatever reason that doesnt seem to be a thing in socal help any advice welcome i have the exact same camera and light setup so maybe i can help troubleshoot your process im gonna break my thoughts up into bullet points so its hopefully not too much of a wall of text p first thing as an entry level camera the t is relatively low in resolution are you attempting to get your print files in one shot it is possible to create small to medium prints with the mp files but it means you need the right lens and your shot needs to be really precise as you discovered to avoid distortion part of your trouble with getting a perfectly square image may be your lens as some will have more distortion than others around the edges or it could just be the struggle of getting the camera perfectly parallel to the  my method is to use a fixed macro lens to take multiple close up photos of the  and then have my editing program stitch them together into a larger file the main benefit of this is being able to make much bigger prints but a side benefit is that i dont have to be quite so spoton perfect with one single shot any minor distortion gets corrected in editing but thats a whole separate method of making print files theres tutorials on youtube that will walk you through it if you want to experiment so for now lets say your lens is fine and you get one shot that youre mostly happy with for the editing stage ive never used rawtherapee but i would suggest skipping any preset adjustments and instead manually tweaking anything that looks off compared to the original levels color balance etc for print youll likely want to bump it a tiny bit lighter because ink on paper is darker than a backlit screen but thats what test prints are for for actually ordering the prints first you have to think about the aspect ratio of your  and what size you want the prints to be compared to what sizes are offered by the print company youre going to use if your  is nonstandard and your print site only offers standard options youll have to choose between cropping the  to fit or leaving white margins around the edges its personal preference but traditionally most fine  prints are not cropped and instead a larger white border is added instead of uploading your  file asis and letting the site place it on a page i always recommend making your file the full paper size with your  sized and placed how you want it youll have more control over placement and there wont be any frustrating surprises with size or unexpected borders i hope something in there helps i tried to keep it super basic if you have more specific questions id be happy to clarify for aligning the camera one trick is to use a laser and mirror when the laser bounces right back to the spot where emanates you are perfectly parallel for colors you should use a color checker and make a custom camera profile for printing whenever you do full bleed the print lab will trim a bit of the edges off generally its best practice to print with a border anyway as that makes it easier to handle the print and frame it ive found with a local lab its easy to tell them print exactly x by y and add a border but volume labs online arent going to want to do that so you add white space to the exact size of the paper raw therapee is probably the last processing  i would recommend to someone if you have photoshop just use camera raw to process,0.9954,positive
AIart,print paper recommendations i recently got a canon pro printer and im excited to start selling prints im trying to figure out what the best paper to use is i got some sample sheets from canon which are good but are obviously aimed at photographers because theres nothing textured id like something with a texture to it like a lowtexture watercolour paper prices vary hugely and as im starting out there are definitely some im priced out of does anyone have any recommendations for the lower price range for example i love the look of the hahnemuehle durer but cad for sheets is too much at least until ive got the hang of printing and know i can sell i also dont know if i can i use regular artists paper it will be possible to print on quite a large range of paper so i would recommend trying out multiple types to find your best fit for your needs the higher end products will give better results with less hastle eg produce proper contrastcolor with icc profiles and minimal input but dont rule out less common paper that isnt optomized for inkjet i have had surprising results with  papers with some manual color correctionstinkering get to know the paper settings in the professional print layout  to test paper most of the higher end brands sell sample packs eg red river moab etc or you can sometimes find people selling opened packs on facebook marketplacecraigslist check out the cansonarches aquarelle i use that on my canon pro for my  prints and havent found anything better yet have you looked into red river im not sure if they have the sort of textured paper youre looking for but their paper is quite good  invest in some sample packs of the good papers hahnemuhle canson red river if you like a paper but its too expensive you can usually google and find a less expensive alternative red river papers are often half the cost i use hahnemuhle photo rag matte and photo rag baryta satin a lot canson aquarelle and canson are great thanks very much ive done a few test prints and so far everything is coming out too dark except for the test print i used that was fine im using the canon paper i got with the printer so the printer is working fine i just need to figure out how to set up my images correctly ill definitely check out the  you mentioned thanks what did you need to do to set up your printer to print on that paper did you need any special profile or anything all i did was set it as heavy  paper on the printer and the same setting on the canon print and layout application,0.9954,positive

art,lacking confidence in my  ive been wanting to set up my own  business for years but i get worried every time i deep dive into trying to plan it id love to sell my original paintings printsetc but theres always something at the back of my head that i will struggle to get regular customers what was your worries when you started your business and how did you change your mindset what did you do to keep your customers engaged on social media to get consistent sales so many people wait until things are ready or just right to get started i recommend jumping in as you are and letting things fall into place and grow organically i didnt intend to sell  when i started  but id post current works on fb or such and get interest i opened up an etsy shop so people could buy from there easily there is  for every one your  will have an audience that loves it and hates it that is good ive been so surprised by some of the things i have sold over the years things i would have just tossed in the garbage i started doing small  fairs in my town small exhibitions i dont pay my etsy much mind these days and still get sporadic sales sorry i dont have advice about consistent customers i mainly just wanted to say go for it put your stuff out there and give people the chance to love it if you are worried to start just start small d maybe create an online portfolio maybe book some small exhibition space from local library etc preferably something free start doing social media participate in local events etc just start with something to feel it out a bit find some audience connections etc before launching further into the business as for keeping customer engaged for consistent sales just producing good  content interacting with others etc helps not that much experience selling paintings prints but this is very general rule it might be difficult to find people interested in your work meta is making it ever so difficult to find new small accounts but you have to make the effort and reach out to people yourself and i was not originally that worried in my business i was mostly lacking confidence in my skills a bit worried to get enough money in and as i still struggle with my business and confidence mental health is lovely d i have realised i will probably never stop worrying and if i let that stop me i would have never even started so worrying might never end and you might have to accept it and maybe find some suitable mental strategies to cope with that good luck i think this is something i needed to hear thank you i guess i just need to give it a chance and see what happens and trial and error do you just do prints on your etsy now ive been debating between shopify and etsy leaning more to the shopify route i have a couple prints on etsy but i mostly sell acrylic on  i think the reason i dont shut down my etsy is its pretty self sufficient while i forget about it i should probably take a few hours to dedicate to it but ive got more pressing things on my mind join your local fb groups and any local  groups you can thats new advise to me on joining those groups ill definitely look into that thank you,0.9981,positive

art,experience of selling fine  at  fairs i recently made this posthttpswwwredditcomrartbusinesssamqcolr tldrmy parent has been making paintings oilacrylic on  mostly between inches smaller and xin bigger ones for the last years or so the parent has pretty much entirely given up on marketing for like the last years and so we have literally hundreds of paintings sitting in the house im trying to shift them now and most people recommended in person sales at  fairs or markets according to my google search i have found that apparently flea market or general  fair settings arent particularly good for selling of fine  people who come view it as an opportunity to go out and eatdrink and they can look at nice artwork not intending to buy it overall people seemed to be making a loss by hiring the stand at the fair they said instead to aim for  fairs which are exclusively for fine  where people are looking to buy fine  is this in line with peoples experience here has anyone been to fine  fairs what was your experience like or shall i price them at like each and hope to sell enough to not make a massive loss lol are you anywhere near birmingham or liverpool theres red brick market which is a place you rent a stall quite cheap stock it up and then dont actually have to work it youre just expected to come in and clean occasionally and stock up when you sell out basically they pay you every weeks and dont take  whatever you do youre gambling money you just have to try things and not go for expensive stalls edit its liverpool not leeds my mistake ooh thank you i will look this up yes ive paid for subscription on singulart and artgallerycouk but havent had a sale yet i know whichever way itll end up costing unfortunately i think online unless youre either a marketing demon or have a lot of marketing money the simple show up and be present isnt working for anyone anymore ive literally stopped trying to get attention on socials cos it just dont work youtube is also a good option but your mom probably wont want to make videos you could make shorts those reveal vids ppl do for eg to showcase them and have a link to a shop if youre willing to do that,0.7832,positive

art,help in choosing  device hello people i need some help in regards on what would be the best option to buy i want to persue digital  professionally i already have a wacom digitizer but it doesnt have a screen and i believe  on a screen straight on would be way better truth is i want a tablet for  because i can carry it everywhere and its convenient i was thinking of buying the samsung galaxy tab s that comes with a pen do you guys think thats a good option or should i go with something like a wacom digitizer with a screen the only thing that is holding me back for the second option is that it has to be connected to a pc in order to work and that limits me what would be best for professional digital  thank you in advance a used older gen wacom one would be a significant upgrade if your computer can hanle it under shipped on ebay usually if ur a windows  check xp pen tablets on youtube if ur an android user as in ur phone is one then the galaxy tab s ultra is a powerful tablet it has got a huge screen too if the screen is too big for your preference then there is a smaller option within the series the one u mentioned is a bit old now and is small in size if ur an ios user as in own an iphone then an ipad pro is amazing u need to get the pen separately mine is from the release there are newer ones if u want something new but keep in mind the price will be expensive with newer models i recommend watching brad colbow on youtube he does so many tablet reviews for so many different brands windows android and the new ipads i use a tab s and would recommend the tab as a great option for starting but get a new version an s or s ideally mine runs out of memory sometimes,0.9966,positive
art,the risk of going professional i always hear about artists going professional and losing their love for  has anyone else experienced this someone replied to my post with a similar story i hear about it often artists using their skills professionally and losing their spark for it as it became their business and thus their livelihood thats also been a fear of mine going professional and losing my love for it due to the business side of it i love telling stories creating characters and worldbuilding for them im not very good at writing animation or d modeling i figured  the thing ive done all my life would simply be my avenue for it thats my medium to tell my stories i cant imagine not going professional not one day managing an animation studio or directing my own films or even video games somehow publishing my work for others to enjoy providing a world for other creatives to be apart of that being said it is a bit terrifying the idea that a dream job at the end of the day is still a job that it might suck the light and fun and maybe even all the enjoyment out of the craft itself im working through this currently years into an  career and three years into a burnout the likes of which i didnt imagine possible my  became a monumental struggle tying everything to my creative output became all consuming i never turned off what i did to support my family and dreams financially merged with what i did for enjoyment life and joy by the time i established any sense of financial stability regularly landing genuinely profitable commissions i was struggling to get myself to focus and produce in the studio turns out that i am not a machine but heres the thing its just another life lesson just another chapter of this adventure called life the experience has defined and deepened my relationship with creativity in ways i could not have imagined possible with the struggle comes a depth i have stressed my relationship with my  in ways that have allowed me to genuinely explore questions of artistic integrity rather than simply maintaining nave opinions about the same yeah if you go pro you might lose your love for your  but then what you could quit and i imagine youll get at least a couple responses from those who did so or you can go deeper find out what lies beyond the infatuation and luster love is deeper than enjoyment its a bit like a marriage you can quit when it gets hard or find the depth that lies beyond even when you land your dream job or build your dream world you still have to learn to be happy and healthy your  or your profession is only a part of that you cant go wrong really follow the most exciting path you can see and just have a blast doing so succeed or fail the only way to ruin a life is to postpone it good luck and have fun i cant speak from actual experience but just generally i guess it depends on why you entered the professional sphere and also what youre doing in that sphere sometimes it can be the best thing you ever did sometimes the worst again it depends making money from the thing does not always mean the thing is now bad it just depends for a random example i actually love cleaning i find it therapeutic but force me to clean oh no i couldnt but some people dont feel that way they enjoy it i went to creative writing school then worked as a part time staff writer for a decade i got seriously bored with it about years in and realized i needed a plan to pivot careerwise writing professionally did not kill my love of the craft it just made it harder to write for my own sake ya know all my writing fuel was reserved for the job still it made me feel good about myself people paid me to write because i am good at it thats pretty darn rad in my eyes after i moved on from that job i was able to get back into writing for me nowadays i make most of my income from  its a better fit for me it is still a job like you cant escape having a job of some sort unless you are rich thats just life but its a job that makes me happy i cant predict how youll react to being a professional  it may be a great fit for you and it may not be good news is most people change careers multiple times throughout our lives if we find ourselves doing something we cant stand we can pivot i prefer to say  is what i do for a living and not for a job it is a way of life theres a ebb and a flow a fest and famine cycle and you will have to lean to navigate and plan for those at times you might have to get a real job to pay the bills in the slow months and that is ok burn out is real it hit me really hard a year ago i had to turn off all my online store the week before black friday i couldnt risk getting a bunch of orders and not fulfilling them luckily i had some saved and could take a break on customs made to order items and just sell what i had on hand i am still learning the balance of production work vs my larger  projects the production work is what makes part of this life  a job but thats what pays the bills i carve out time to make new work and explore new techniques even the long hours of working a huge wholesale order alone in my garage is better than working any real job i have been doing  professionally for about years for these last years i went freelance and i have to yet to lose my love for  i cant really speak for others but ive known artists that werent able to make the switch from hobby to livelihood the reason was usually that they enjoyed dabbling and just doing stuff had entire notebooks full of  some comic strips but that was kinda it the issue with that is that making a living with  doesnt depend on how many hours you spend  and how much you love it it depends on your ability to finish things consistently that i think is where most people fail having to finish stuff take everything to a certain level of polish consistently its just not what they enjoy it requires some discipline and the ability to see things through even if youre getting tired of working on a piece another reason ive seen people fail is because while they enjoy doing  they go down a commissions route basically tying their income in working for others theres a huge difference in how much people enjoy doing their own stuff vs doing what other people want them to do at first theyre thrilled by the idea of being paid to draw x but when that becomes your main source of income you suddenly realize youre not really ever doing what you want youre just like an employee and lastly the third reason ive seen people fail is because they just want to draw do  and thats it to do freelance and be self employed you need to enjoy all parts of it you need to be a bit of an entrepreneur and enjoy making money finding opportunities and markets building up your brand with social media etc etc and you have to be proactive at it also its super difficult to focus and enjoy  when youre living paycheck to paycheck so before making a leap to doing it fulltime id make sure to have a nice cushion so you can afford to work without stress my personal advice would be to figure out what you really could see yourself doing day after day without burning out or hating it and then find the right place and niche market for you which will end up with a compromise between what you like to do and what sells dont just do commissions or another specific freelance model because its what you see some people doing and you like their  figure out what business model is best for you first if  is an escape then be careful in going full time and running your own business reflect a bit on it i enjoy graphic design and the customer satisfaction and positive feedback i paint in my own time and the two things exist side by side however accountancy contracts and in the past personnel management leadership in addition to other mundane business junk can be a whole different burden you have to be up for that challenge as well so its a tricky question some people really enjoy that business side of it too or even more than  as its something to be creative with if youre young fewer responsibilities be flexible give it a go the risk is if you start doing it differently i went through this some years ago create processes that allow you to be creative dont expect to enjoy it in the same way as a hobby a hobby is to unwind destress from work studies you can just do it without care obviously professional  work will be different would you purchase a  that someone did without care with your hard earned money it has limited aesthetic appeal the colours are off etc also once you start building a brand you will want to improve not go backwards this is a good thing however things get easier as you get more experienced it is very possible for that to happen so my advice to you is to tread carefully and really think it through before making the decision you basically have to come to terms with the fact that you might very well start to hate doing what you loved nope i do  full time do not regret it one bit you just have to create a balance for yourself so that you do not get burnt out the important thing is to always save some part of it for yourself always save some space to play do work thats just for your own pleasure its too easy to just work on other peoples ideas and just become a crafts person a pencil monkey dont let that happen i dont do anything related to work when im not getting paid to do it work is work and the difficulty of the job and satisfaction of progress is the reward but ultimately you do it for the paycheck the difference between work and a hobby you love is that the hobby has no ectrrnal benefit the challenge and the success that you achieve for yourself theres no external motivator its just something you do because it makes you happy if you make a job out of  you may be able to have the same level of enjoyment at home the tasks themselves may give you joy but if you are not able to separate the frustrations of the job it will ruin your ability to escape into your hobby _ it can work but you need to be disciplined in how you separate work and play i specifically do not work at home so that i can disconnect after work leave the office and come home to a comfortable location there will be things youll learn that you cannot do in life because the stresses will follow you home and ruin your ability to find peace its a journey of figuring out what those are and then making sacrifices to maintain the mindset you want to have every day i had that happen as a photographer started doing weddings because it paid the bills but it made me lose my passion for it thats why when i started  i told myself id only make whatever i really wanted to do its harder because i could probably make more money by doing pet portraits or murals or live wedding  or whatever else but i dont care for those things and it rather take longer to be able to go full time than force myself to make things im not passionate about what ive learned is that theres an audience for everything and everyone you just have to find it hey preasure running a business any kind of business but lots of people love their jobs so no reason to think you would hate yours could always give it a try and then quit,0.9998,positive

art,going crazy with social media when i have multiple  styles i decided to focus on social media and get my work out there this year i used to only use instagram and it was going somewhat well but now that instagram is crap for small artists i have to branch out to other social media as well the biggest issue is that i have multiple artstyles i have adhd so i cant stick with one  for long i like to have a variety i can switch between i have narrowed it down to these but i dont know how to juggle social media my main account under my real name my personal  i have developed throughout my life cute cozy   in a highly specific niche that i am targeting for cmmissions somewhat low effort funny memey giftable designs for an etsy shop dark gothic black and white moody designs for cmmissions or licensing childrens book  illustrations meant to be sold as products i also do   landscape  pen and ink landscapes and surface design which dont fit in any of these styles but i think i can put those on the back burner for now i currently have instagram and bluesky accounts for styles and that i try to post on a few times a weeki have an etsy shop for my dark gothic work is not out there at all because i dont know where to put it so im thinking of opening a new account for it same with  i dont know if i should open a new etsy shop or combine it with or if anyone reads this first of all thank you and if you have any suggestions id l love to hear them im kind of tempted to just start a bunch of social medias and see what sticks rather than sitting and stressing over it maybe i can focus on one account each day of the week i dont really have any advice because im the exact same adhd multiple  styles multiple accounts its definitely hard what im just realizing in the last few months is that its actually a lot easier to do things in real brick and mortar shops than online i was accepted by a local shop and i can give them anything i make randomly made some clay sculptures that dont fit in any of my accounts no problem i just give them to the shop its very freeing good luck i am close to releasing an app that i think might help you out it allows you to manage multiple social media platforms and accounts from a single dashboard right now it supports reddit and bluesky with more to come after it goes live i could use some early testers if you would be interested question what   is getting you the most sales what is your goal for social media i would be interested in seeing a bit of your work just to see if its possible to incorporate parts of them into each other to reduce the amount of accounts you have to manage saying this because i a fellow adhd  tried making different accounts for different stylescontent only to burn out and end up with just one though none of the accounts have ever made me money so i cant offer solid business advice i didnt have as many accounts as you just having one for my personal  one for cutesy animal  and another for niche fanart for the one i use now its based on my personal  but it has fluctuated and evolved over time i used to worry about my   being inconsistent but the different variations of this  arent actually that different whether im doing  or digital cellshading or painterly i still have a consistent approach to anatomy especially with how i draw faces so i dont feel the need to partition my  based on super specific stylistic differences have you considered trying youtube im not very experienced with it but its given me better growth than the other platforms i use from observation i think its also more common to see artists experimenting withchanging up their  there i remember watching a video of an  cant remember who saying that she didnt feel so boxed in on youtube compared to ig vaguely recall her saying that on ig she was stuck doing  paintings of birds but on yt she can explore other mediums like charcoal thats awesome unfortunately most of my work is digital or custom so i cant take them to a store i just got started doing some physical items so im going to try doing a market in the spring im interested im also interested if you still need testers but then how will i spend hours overthinking each post sure id be interested in trying it in terms of amount of money my main account although with the algorithm changes im not being seen by anyone anymore so thats probably out the door now but i do use it as a portfolio to send it to potential clients in terms of number of sales the etsy account the last two are not uploaded anywhere as of now so i cant tell if they have potential to get more eyes on my work to hopefully attract clients or to market the shops great good news is you have actual money you can measure your success with i say put your energy into the funnel thats performing the best and work on the other stuff when youre not doing that the great thing about diversity is your appeal to different markets as a business it makes sense to develop your lines of business that are doing the best once you have set up your system make that line efficient then you can build on your other products i know that this can be frustrating as an  that needs to be making different things all the time i feel you on this one so take some time out of your week to experiment in private not everything you do has to be profitmaking and its important to have a sense of what you just like so you can keep doing what youre doing thanks i feel like im too early in each brand to gauge whether they are successful or not like is this account not succeeding because there is no demand for it or because its only been month and its still too early to call it,0.9991,positive
art,creating a resumecv when  isnt your primary job how important are resumes and cvs for independent artists  isnt my primary job i work in education and i have no formal training in  but im trying to take my  business more seriously is it worth it to create an arttailored resumecv should i leave out my irrelevant work experience i do have a website with an about me section and a digital portfolio of my work so my  history is already visible that way i have a separate cv tailored for applications in the arts i think its good to have a more specific one readily on hand theyre not important i dont have one and have been selling work through a  for two years and on my own for two years before that in fact i would argue that a thinly padded cv works against you as a beginning  as it highlights how little experience you have even worse would be to include irrelevant work experience,0.6918,positive

art,any similar websitecompany as vograce im ordering my stuff from vograce which is actually good  but im curious if there is any other similar company to vograce you reccommend qualitywise and pricewise im interested in ordering custom prints stickers and tarot cards the most for now as im building my own collections custom tarot cards from vograce are sometimes hit or miss even if i write them in notes for designs to be centered one specific vograce employee who takes my order does it amazing and everything on point sadly its not always up to him to take my orders thank you whoever decides to help if youre looking for tarot cards and prints try qinprinting their moq is they have their own website and alibaba page i recognize some of the samples on their website as successful fanzine projects too they dont do stickers though for general merch like charms standees buttoms etc juno creative is another alternative i personally wouldnt use vograce since theyre the most popular so their turnaround time is awful thank you im new to discovering such websites so ill definitely check those out for vograce i dont mind waiting for sticker arrivals since im doing for my personal use for now but i can understand why their turnaround time might be slow for business artists for sure a question for qinprinting and jc is printing  similar to vograce since i do like  of vograce so thats why im asking qin specializes in  printing and arguably should do a better job since their only job is printing theyre used in the fanzine space and everyone there says its great as long as you can meet the moq jc i believe is a bit better in  at worst it should be the same they just dont have an english standalone website and the same level of marketing vograce has also since you said it was for personal use their moq is but you can split it into pc per design if they all share the same specs but with stickers im assuming youre only ordering stickers there and chinese shipping and possible tariffs imo at that point youre better off ordering from a us sticker printer stickerbunnies is us based charges cents per sticker with no moq and as someone who orders there their  is great you have to contact them through email to order they dont have an order form,0.995,positive
art,looking for advice on converting an  loft into a live in  space i posted on rartistlounge but got no responses so im reposting here hopefully to more avail i moved into a starter apartment in brooklyn about yrs ago ive amassed a lot of machines for leather working and d printing and ive reached critical mass im looking to move into an industrial space when my lease is up in months but there is a scarcity of live in  spaces and the studios within my budget are usually without a private bathroom or have a private bathroom without a shower head im trying to gather information or advice for either obtaining a live in  space or assuming i can find a loft with a private bathroom converting it into a live in  space from what ive read going the legal route and rezoning an industrial space to be a residential space is a bureaucratic nightmare and could take thousands of dollars and multiple years so im open to legally ambiguous solutions i do know people who illegally occupied an artists studio for a couple of years they had to rig up a shower and run it from a bagtank it was a pretty marginal existence but it cost way less than even a room in an apartment i think years was about the limit though i can tell you what i know of artists doing this in ri in old mills being rented out as artists work lofts the landlord finds out and has them arrested and locked out on the spot this happened numerous times in a mill i lived in one of the residential units and i heard of it happening in other mills i go camping and you can learn a lot about creative ways to live from folks living out of their cars for example how to make a portable shower water pumphttpsyoutubewzvqajvissismnmicpvlneqh which has a ton of useful applications you can get one of them outdoor shower tents and put something underneath to catch the water i dont live in my studio but i do have it set up for comfort for when i get hungry or sleepy nobody will look twice at a mini fridge i have been using an electric steamer lunch boxhttpsyoutubeeyavgxdodxusinpladpvqozvmnaz a little smaller than this to cook meals and these are cheap and easy to store check out more solutions among the vanlife camper and car living communities for solutions just make sure you can put this stuff away during the day and that includes your bed a futon that folds into seating is gonna be your best bet here it wont be easy but it can be done just dont make it obvious,0.9869,positive
art,licensing on stickers so i was recently contacted by a bar owner who would like to use one of my  pieces as sticker seals for to go drinks apparently their former social media person put that same  piece on their website not as a sale item just decoration and the owners spent a year trying to track me down theyve already bought a bunch of stickers from red bubble but asked if we could do some sort of licensing since per sticker would be expensive is there a special type of licensing i should look for what would yall think is a reasonable price range for stickers on to go cups googles kinda all over the place which just left me more confused is there a reason youre looking to license vs bulk printing the stickers and shipping them or just charging a flat fee and letting them handle it redbubble is pricy because the stickers are printed in small runs but its much cheaper to print stickers if you get them in bulk from a sticker company i worked with a coffee shop and printed a roll of stickers round size x on stickermule for about charged them for the roll and they used them around the holidays for a limited run now i do all their stickerspaper goods but usually larger quantities so the price per stickerpaper product is cheaper but my profit is still really good as a first time run and for such a small market i would suggest a flat fee its basically one design for one client you can draw up a contract if you want but its just a single design it sounds like it would be more cost effective to let them order those on rolls or sheets the biggest issue is whether or not you are going to continue to sell the design on your own or just let them have it unless you are asking to run and manage production for them but do you really want to manage the ops for this client the easiest way to look at this is like a freelance design job have them pay you for the design and let them run the stickers maybe ask if you can post your bcards or flyers about your websitedesigns business good luck op do a one time merch fee non exclusive to the artwork they would then print the stickers themselves apparently my reason is that i over thought this whole thing and spiraled into some nonsense lol theyre business is in a different state so i think it will work out better to do a flat fee and let them run the stickers thanks for this i didnt even think of this it would be so much easier running it like a freelance design i feel like i brain farted out any common sense in my surprise over this lol i do plan on keeping the rights to my design shes originally from a comic thats been living on the backburner for ages i thought of offering a customized logo with her so theyll have something unique for the business i like this much better idea thank you,0.9974,positive

art,struggling with online sales why cant i get anyone to my website my  sells at shows but its online where i struggle ive paid for a marketing plan via fiverr tried implementing those tactics seo tags social media posting etc i just cant catch a break it seems so easy for other beginning artists but i cannot afford to hire someone to do it for me there are only so many hours in the day for me to not only create but also try to keep up with marketing any advice or am i sol i had the same situation for many years selling fine in galleries but crickets online other than commissions now i average around online sales per day with no advertising and the key for me is that almost all those sales are for the same pieces theyre the ones that are the most decorative include popular subjects andor fit niches that are frequent searches as an example according to stats some of the highest ranked search terms that lead people to my shop are things like cheese gifts and absinthe poster that doesnt work for everyone and every type of  of course especially if youre only selling originals but its another option to consider rather than trying to get general  buyers to come look at your whole shop think of what purpose someone might have for your  home decor themes a gift for people who like ____ etc where theyre shopping and what terms theyre using to search and then try to get your listings on those places using those keywords if youre only using a standalone website thats starting on hard mode people dont explore the internet like they used to so youll have to work much harder to reach potential customers if possible trying out an existing marketplace can be well worth the fees they charge heres my experience with getting  sales online social it takes time you need to build an audience either through social media by niching down this is probably the most important piece all niches are not created equally as an example subject matter about daisies is going to be a lot harder to market than boston terrier lovers engaging with a specific community you should spend time on your subject matters subreddits niceh facebook groups and ig pages building a following create content weekly a few social posts and an email create a value ladder like giving way lowres phone backgrounds of your  gray malin does this well offer printondemand products at lower price points commenting you need to comment in your community if igfb shows you more  content than your niche content then youre not engaging enough in your niche becoming a genuine part of that community doing collabs reaching out to the microinfluencers to do giveaways or another creative angle youll gain followers and eventually sales but you must create engaging content that gives back to the community seo wouldnt recommend for starting out and better as something you build in the background especially until you really find your niche this requires at least year of hard work just focused on seo understanding domain authority your site needs to gain backlinks over time to show up for searches building website reputation over time too much to go into here creating valuable content around your  blog posts helpful and thoughful information alternative approach shows and festivals attend inperson  festivals specific to your niche this might be netnegative in terms of profitability per show for your first few your primary goal should be to gather leads rather than make sales but if you make sales then youre off to a good start make direct connections ask questions about people coming up to your booth and try to write down the details somewhere send out emails after the show saying it was nice meeting them include the info you talked about this takes a bit of extroversion and organization use qr codes to build email lists do giveaways at the show or some free small gift for getting on your email list bookmarks postcards etc with all of the above make sure to get peoples email and dont spam them send nurturing update emails weekly or at least monthly this time of year is a much better audience building time of the year shift your north star from making sales to gaining an audience for your  youll start to see results compound over time and sales will eventually come its hard selling work online photos dont do the work justice usually and its hard to get an idea of scale so it makes sense not sure if you do this but taking a video of your work zooming in to see details maybe you holding the  to get an idea of scale and getting shots of it in different lighting or even in a frame would help over time once you build a solid inperson customer base they should start feeling more comfortable buying online its also just kind of a terrible time to sell  people are always less likely to buy after the holidays and with taxes in mind plus if youre in the us a lot of people are hurting financially and just trying to afford eggs keep going it sounds like youre doing the right things youre not alone i struggle with consistency i do think if i could sort that out id have more momentum have you put consistent effort into one strategy over a period of time do you have a favorite strategy lean into it well i would say sometimes selling online lacks the certain human element compared to  shows it could also be you can communicate yourself and your  better verbally vs online there are naturally differences yes but still also online can be nasty the competition is high and if you do not have a well thoughtout plan target audience etc for your marketing you just get lost it is also increasingly difficult for people to find your  by themselves due to this which needs more marketing etc and  is one difficult thing to market as everyone has their visual tastes and they might vary a lot so it is quite a lottery to try and find people who might be interested in your  and maybe people at  events are just generally more open already looking to buy  compared to random people just scrolling social media etc how about selling on etsy diverting internet traffic to your site is hard etsy at least does a lot of that heavy lifting for you most consumers just shop via google search first page amazon or temu i cant even imagine the struggle of bringing customers to my own website i just dont have it in me to do that much work i sell my  on etsy lots of people shop for  on there do your  sales mostly come from a marketplace like you mentioned are you driving traffic there from social or is it coming from the market thats there already building a solid niche community and engaging authentically online is key ive been in the  scene long enough to see that your online strategy has to mirror the genuine vibe you have at shows when focusing on your niche and connecting with likeminded groups your audience starts growing naturally even if sales take time to pick up i struggled balancing  and marketing too until i switched tactics ive tried facebook ads and basic email tools but pulse for reddit is what i ended up using because it helped me target the right reddit communities without extra hassle focusing on genuine relationships over immediate sales has really worked what do you mean by using qr codes to build email lists or rather how does that work,0.9993,positive
art,grantsfunding pulled due to new eos hi im a  owner in ga one of our artists just had a major show pulled in a large dc museum keeping this vague so his privacy is protected due to trumpdoge cutting funding the show was focused on queer artists and im pretty devastated for him i knew all these eos were eventually going to impact the  world but i havent heard much talk around it yet in the  community anyone else experiencing similar issues i ed a nonprofit  we are all prepared for things to get worse ive been in regular communication with our states arts council and many local public arts councils all of them are forecasting tough years ahead we will have to lean on private donors more than ever really upsetting to hear didnt think shows already scheduled would be pulled like this you may find more feedback in rcontemporaryart was your artists show pulled because it was about queer artists or was it pulled just because the museum lost funding and they had to pull several other shows too just curious im preparing to submit for a local  and i would like to know what you think happened there before i select pieces re experiencing similar issues i havent experienced such yet because i typically work as a commercialproduct design  and fashion designer instead of a   but i have worked with companies whove already had problems with tariffs spiking the prices of their goods there are a lot of things that simply cannot be manufactured in the usa due to our fair labor laws lack of infrastructure etc but theyre still getting hammered with tariffs due to these eos not looking forward to all the price spikes were gonna be seeing soon is it because the show is choosing artists based on sexual orientation glad to hear that youre in talks with your reps funding in non profits is already so tight and im so frustrated to hear that major government funds are getting axed so tech bros make more money its so gross honestly good question i should follow up and ask him im also dreading the repercussions from the tariffs especially considering one of our biggest artists is canadian and we have a lot planned for him this year edit from what he implied its because it was a lgbtq focused show well lucky for us s we may not have fair labor laws for long i think he just got rid of osha this week good luck with your submission well if its due to fair labor laws fuck the people trying to skirt that for  its trash that obviously cares more about money well you cant do a queer  show without queer artists haha but yes thats why its on the chopping block for funding edit  definitely implied that its being cut because of antidei measures but i dont have written proof but also it seems pretty clear the current administration has been very upfront with what they wont tolerate and lgbtq grantsfunding are one of the issues theyre most vocally opposed to no they were carefully selective of artists of any and all sexual orientation re your edit jeez i wonder if the gallerycurator saw that dei wasnt mandatory anymore and was like now we have an excuse not to do this show or if they felt like they needed to cut the show or theyd lose funding not that it really matters in the end it still sucks for your  but if its the former thats a museum id never set foot in again osha is effected by trumps regulatory freeze but it seems like theres only one freak in the house who wants osha completely abolished and none of his fellow republicans have cosigned the bill who knows what trump will decide though considering big corporations have been braying for the death of osha since the s its the eo it specifically calls for all dei activities to cease had they not they would become a target for the next four years,0.94,positive

art,tell me fandoms that  fanart for gets followers on twitter im not caring about twitter dying and i dont want to do nsfw tell me any fandom that is good to stick with and draw fanart for that can bring a following all of them you should pick fandoms you actually like because if youre just doing it for views it shows in your work you should really just draw things youre passionate about because in order to get followers from a fandom you have to draw it often and enough that people can recognize you draw for that fandom and this is easier if youre into the fandom and its characters to preface what i am about to say yes draw what you are passionate about so you can have fun and be more motivated to create  for it but to answer your question usually the top trending games or animated shows have large and active fan base that have a demand for fan arts for example anime  games such as genshin zenless z zero arc knight arknights limbus company etc games that have emphasis on characters this can be hero shooters like overwatch marvel rivals etc idol anime shows or vtubers anime or ips such as love live idlmaster or popular vtubers like hololive idols or popular independents like dokibird just to name a few popular or trending shows this can be popular anime like one piece or currently trending anime like dandadan and dont forget western comics characters popular characters like the ones in marvel rivals or the ones featured in a cartoon like justice league im sure there are probably better ideas or things you can do to gain more traction within an fandom and i am by no means a pro at this either i am just providing what i have observed that gets decently popular if you do mainly character  try to explore and interact on bluesky and tumblr as i see those platforms have more actively participating communities you should be  what you want but fuck it heres fandoms that do numbers because im on twitter for fandoms too the fandoms i observe have the most engagements also have the most mm ship presence because its the fujin who make fandoms go around insert pray to god fujoshi draw your goat taking it up the butt or else your favorite shounen mangas going to get axed meme genshin impact honkai star rail zenless zone zero hoyoverse juggernauts coupled with a really lax fanmerch policy makes them have a lot of people who like the game and

terms of shipping though final fantasy one piece ace attorney fire emblem not in it but its a long standing fandom based off the amount of fanzine projects still going on for them baldurs gate attractive characters lots of ships good game in general astarion has a ton of people in a chokehold trending seasonal anime dandadan frieren dungeon meshi etc fanart does numbers but idk how long an actual fandom will stay theres not too much to flesh out and world build which is what makes fandoms last longer than youd think literally just go to archiveofourownorg go to animemangawhatever your media niche pick and pick the fandoms that have a shitload of fanfiction and have a lot of fanfic updated per week the exception here is safe and generic coolcute fandoms like ghibli and sanrio cute aesthetic  like that does numbers by the algorithm putting it on peoples feeds and because of how palatable they are but people dont go out of their way to search for it real fandoms are leaving twitter i have drawn for many fandoms and never got anywheremy  is not even bad honestly its just that it never worked for the ones i liked literally this post lol hoyoverse fandom goes nuts my biggest regret in life is that i dont play video games so i can draw fanart for them im also not into idols and vtubers category im just into anime and manga i think the currently popular anime is the best option for me thank you such a useful comment this is so informative thank you thats not surprising tbh being a fan  is hard because youre competing in an oversaturated market with artists of varying skill levels so its harder to find particular artists to begin with the thing about fan  is its difficult to keep an audience because as soon as you swap fandoms the old fandom may lose interest in your work you need to pick a fandom thats long standing and not likely to go anywhere like star trek star wars dnd mlp which is super popular in china rn or furries which gives you literally any animal based movie or show to draw fanart of you could pick anime if you like that route but then id recommend  for multiple anime fandoms at the same time and also keep on top of the most popular animes at the given moment so you can match with what people are watching while still retaining at least some of your older followers by  for more than one show at a time yeah it can be hard you have to really keep at something and its easier with more niche fandoms than with  something massively popular since theres more competition ive been  the same book every few days for years now and finally hit followers but doing a lot of  for one fandom tends to draw in more people than doing a hit n run  of a single piece for many different things if your fandom is really small and you do want followers it might be good to think about other medias you enjoy that are more popular and you could commit yourself to  often developing your skills can also help and doing more impressive pieces i notice painted  or  with backgrounds seems to catch more peoples attention can get attention on your account or doing funny fandom posts since people seem more likely to engage with things they find funny i wish you luck though i think i have to take the fanart route which your strategy sounds really good cause i dont play video games or know others can i ask you what book do you draw and if you can get commissions in your twitter account yeah its difficult really thank you for taking time and leaving this comment,0.9998,positive

art,advice on pricing for wine labels hi i make  prints and someone wants to buy some rights to put one on a wine label thinking a flat rate of but that feels crazy anyone with experience on product labels have an idea of what i should be charging i live in the pnw of the united states i charge around to design a label with some options and revisions with commercial usage so at least with the full rights this aligns with recommended pricing for the rights to a greeting card for example generally when selling rights to an artwork the rule of thumb is a increase of the price of the piece are they looking to  a label to buy the rights or is this something that is already been created thank you this is very helpful information its a  ive done already that they want to use should i do of the originals cost thank you for your reply v much appreciated no it should be more like x there are some published guidelines for designers full rights to a bookmark should be around or with commercial usage rights,0.9819,positive
art,are digital  files ok to sell im new to this ive seen people do this on etsy but now i am second guessing myself all of a sudden i have major anxiety over this and i just want to be brave and sell my  and be able to pay for food i dont have a printer so for now im keeping it simple with digital files to send to people any advice on doing it this way thank you edit i am holding off for now since a lot of helpful people informed me about licensing and possible stolen work if anyone has any experience selling digital fileslicense to use the photo please feel free to message me ill gladly take any advice or tips im a freelance digital illustrator my clients only get a digital file through email or cloud storage i am commissioned and do not sell through a store however i am also selling the rights to the image to them so they can use for a cover to sell a book or whatever other promotional material they may have there is no issue with selling the digital file of  for them to print and hang on the wall but you should make it clear that you are retaining the rightscopyright to the image and that is for personal use only otherwise you may get people using your file to make and sell tshirts with your work on it that may happen anyways but this way it makes it easier to protect yourself under the law i have never sold on my work through a store so i cant give you advise on how to best word it on a product page i would look at other people on esty doing the same thing as an example for you to follow i would make it clear that it is a file and not a print i would state the file type and file size they will be getting resolutionsize and dpi and how it will be sent to them these are the things that i would look for if i were interested in buying an  in a digital format you also may want to add a disclaimer about the how the colors may be slightly different to what is shown on the page do to the differences in different monitors and different printers just something i see on store pages good luck well stock images are digital files and they have been selling for a long time personally i do not do it imo it devalues the  it allows the person to reproduce it at will and as many times as they want of course this depends on file size and its possible to put limits on the sale if you do want to go that route i would encourage you to license the image rather than sell it what people are really doing is buying a license to have permission to use it in that license are the usage conditions but yes the problem with that lies in policing the license as an individual it would be hard to monitor whether or not someone is violating the agreement and if you do find its happening you need to pay for a lawsuit this is a problem everywhere i read a complaint recently by a husband wife pair of artists who shared digital copies with a  owner in europe and found prints for sale in greece and other countries without permission i have seen stolen  books on amazon etsy has potential to be a nightmare if you miss safeguards i dont share digital copies anything unless they are low resolution and i am willing to see it get out of control do not do that ur files will be used as public domain and u will find it sold and someone els profits off of it maybe start selling the sketch version the lineart version could be sold as a digital coloring book though it could also be used for profit by someone else who prints it into a book that said i would suggest taking commissions and save up to invest in a printer then sell prints and invest in a cricut to sell stickers and grow ur  business deleted why wouldnt they be yes but u have to be ok with it possibly being stolen i always share low res unfinished versions with watermark and never lossless i was starting to sell digital files but now decided to go the physical route digital  becomes real  if kept in the real world and it will be better for the  in the long run yes make sure you have print instructions with your files bought a simple file just text a few years ago and it came with some simple print instructions preferred paper size etc years later the print still looks good i hope so ive been selling my digital  files for the last years now and made some good money yes it is good and legit way to sell your  in fact with etsy you can sell digital files and if you like have it be printed on demand by printful or printify i dont do this yet i know i have purchased digital files of brushes i use on my ipad with various apps and i got that brush from another  things to consider make it apparent its only a digital file make sure you create said  in the largest file consider dpi or pixel count file type some are better than others audience deleted if your selling files license to make sure they are for single use printing i would probably instead license the image through a larger company that has all the info depends upon how much you love your original and with nft although it seems that there is a lot of controversy with this topic i dont have much idea how they work either its supposed to be a way to sell  digitally right thank you so much for this this is all extremely helpful i see what you mean about devaluing  sadly i am putting that on hold for now but i do wish i was printing instead but thank you so much for your help ill need to look into this how do you go about licensing vs selling invoice right now i mostly do venmo and paypal to start out this isnt an official business or anything yet i appreciate your advice,0.999,positive
art,advice needed account approach hey there im thinking of getting back into posting  online after a while of not doing so ive always enjoyed  characters fanart original fandom etc and sometimes experimenting with different  styles that said id like to ask for your opinion what do you think of accounts with this kind of approach for example one day i might post fanart from a video game and the next an original character thats a cartoonish animal as an  user or even potential client would you follow an account like this do you think its harder to build an audience if your content is unpredictable ive seen some people create separate accounts for different types of  even for  any advice or thoughts would be really helpful thanks in advance,0.9614,positive

art,advice on how to become a childrens book illustrator hi im an illustrator from mxico and i aspire to work on picture and chapter books unfortunately im pretty lost in regards of how to accomplish this ive been sending my portfoliohttpswwwlucaguevaramedinacom to publishers the last few months and havent heard back from any ive also been looking for jobs on upwork but the majority offer tops for an entire book ive heard people say you should avoid working with self published authors and get an agent but others say agents dont want inexperienced people and to find work for yourself first a couple of days ago i sent my portfolio to a few different  agencies to see if i might get a response does anyone have any tips or steps i could try or should i just keep promoting my work on social media and hope for the best i do childrens books for a living for years for the big pubs in the usa no road is clear cut but heres some very broad tips steer far away from freelancing sites like upwork dont do this to yourself same with self published authors just dont publishers dont usually hire unrepped artists they can and do i was unrepped until recently but its very rare i would advise against illustrationonly agencies and focus on literary agencies that rep artists instead working in publishing is a marathon not a sprint it can take years to get hired etc if you need work experience one example is to make covers or spot illustrations for hypothetical book ideas or public domain classics is there an scbwi branch you can join to connect with other childrens artists try hitting up sites like kidlit for more topics im going to give a brief rewind of my life story which includes your aspiration and how i managed to illustrate childrens books in the late s my desire to do highly inspirational childrens books was like yours our styles are different but yours is great i started by visiting my kids elementaty school and reading books that kids aged picked out for me then after doing that for a bit i read my favorite to them where the wild things are by maurice sendak i also chatted with the teachers a lot and put that experience down as my market research in a fit of inspiration i created my own picture book then returned to read that it was a hit word got out and i ended up visiting about ish local elementary schools in one case the lunchroom was converted to fit classes and i had my drawings on an overhead projector on the strength of letters of recommendation from about teachers i was able to secure a litterary agent in nyc we got a publishing contract for the book i did then three more the actual end result of income wasnt great as the financial pressures on childrens book publishing at the time caused issues only two were actually published and for a short run fast forward to todays marketplace consider involving yourself in parenting subreddits and facebook groups make your intentions known discover what they want for their children craft your own illustrated story find follow and engage active parents teachers and publishers on social mediia and promote the hell out of your work make a series of shortreel videos for each illustrated panel get your work out there a lot create onepanel vignette stories in your  keep creating if your efforts take off one of two things will happen an agent or publisher will engage you or your popularity will make selfpublshing via platform like amazons profitable i hope that helps inspire you and i wish you luck my mother is a retired childrens book illustrator and the publishing industry is really rough theres barely any money to be made advance payments are very small and most books go straight to amazon at a deep discount which just kills your royalty income editors will sit on manuscriptdummy submissions for months with no contact if its something you really want to do my advice would be to find established childrens book authors to collaborate with theyll have publishing connections already so find out where authors hang out i just want to say your work is just so clean nice and professional theres this facebook group that im not even apart of but every now and then ill get bombarded with some posts from it i can count the amount of times ive seen some truly lovely work the rest is hundreds of people who look like theyve just picked up a  tablet and started throwing their first digital  at people who want someone to illustrate their book it makes every post pointless to open because theyd never be able to dig through all those comments to find a   and half of them dont even comment with an example of their work or even listing their website at the bare minimum already youve outclassed a lot of people so take some comfort in that im afraid i dont have much advice beyond keeping your social medias organised concise and professional keep your name and email in your bio and on your portfolio images and personally ive never seen anything worthwhile pop up on one of those side hustle sites youll burn yourself out for nothing good luck i love your work man i wish i had knowledge for that area and could help you because i absolutely looooove your work but at most ive been hired freelance for a couple of book covers and have a possible upcoming job of illustrating a rich guys childrens book he wrote who contacted me through one of my galleries that carry my work so only luck at this point i hope you have amazing success in all you do where can i follow your progress i would love to watch now pieces come out i love your work i dont have any direct advicemaybe some ideas short story i got into  to create a comic this morphed into a childrens book ive never pursued it much i didnt even work on it till years ago years ago tech was crap today i create anything ipad social media ideas think outside the box expand your social media presence instagram good start but what about behance dribbble tiktok youtube cara artstation deviant x or bluesky more eyes more opportunities expand your scope take advice above write your own book you got the characters publish companies agents etc are good but they are dinosaurs compared to whats available now reading the comments above sounds like the dinosaurs are greedy or exclusive so what can you do its limitless as long as your open minded and determined ideas have you looked into cryptocurrency theres a big  presence there there are opportunities to sell your  and also create various media the problem media books comics newspapers magazines are still relevant but all arewill change to the digital medium the best job i even had fun and enjoyed was working at a newspaper  political cartoonbut that newspaper no longer exists are there any mexican publishing houses your work is good im also currently trying to get a book agent as a childrens book authorillustrator right now they are looking for nonwhite stories books about people from bipoc or marginalized groups if you can come up with a book submission and some sample illustrations you can start sending out submissions to agents google manuscript wish list agents have pages where they say what kind of stories they are looking for its a very difficult thing to do but ive heard that its much easier to get an agent if you write and illustrate the book yourself its harder if youre just one or the other number one tip dont contact publishers directly of your emails are going straight in the bin look for agents instead they are people who contact publishers essentially with permission who can sell your idea on your behalf they dont charge for the service they just take a small cut when youre offered work its the only real way to do it outside of selfpublishing perhaps list your service and portfolio on a service like fiverr or upwork also stay posting examples on tiktok instagram and tumblr to build an online presence thank you so much for all the tips i hadnt considered checking out literary agencies ill definitely look into them and youre totally right about it being a marathon i know that ive got to temper my expectations and keep working on it slowly there seems to be a mexican branch of scbwi so ill look into it and see if there are any events i may be able to attend in the future i hope its ok if i ask how you got started with publishing work id love to hear about it thank you so much for sharing your experience i can imagine how amazing it must feel to know your story was well liked by so many kids and their families i definitely try to keep creating on a consistent basis i publish a little comic strip online and wrote and illustrated a picture book with the same characters though im only beginning to look into having it published ill totally work on making reels for my illustrations i suppose it all comes down to reaching the right audience again thank you so much for your advice it certainly seems like a tough industry to break into especially since there seemingly isnt a set path to do so i decided to send my work to a few agencies despite not having professional experience with books in hopes of getting noticed but i have no clue whether itll work out id love to work with established authors though i imagine they likely already have goto illustrators still ill look into promoting my work in more authorgeared spaces thank you for the advice sadly i think you might be right about upwork and sites like it i see tons of listings asking for  books where the pay is basically nothing still they get lots of bids ive seen a few agented illustrators who have been discovered through social media so ill follow your tip and try making mine as appealing as possible thanks for the kind words and the advice,0.9997,positive

art,consignment split increase i am part of a collective in which lots of artists sell their goods the cost split is now the previous manager has bought the business and the first thing she has done is raise that split to is high anyway but how this is so beyond frustrating im sitting at almost when my  just sits there there is no promotion of my items there is no spotlights on artists like was previously mentioned theres no work into selling my items my items are constantly messed up covered with dust need tended to all of this is said to be included in this low rent split but nothing has been met on their part im just so beyond angry at this point once my contract is up im obviously leaving i just needed to vent i think how frustrating that i absolutely my ass to put out my work i get zero help from this place in any sort of way and yet im still being told of this increase cooooool may be necessary to pay the bills these days is not rare i suggest you and other artists in the  unify and present her with some expectations such as increased or more effective marketing perhaps better lighting or cleaned up  walls etc you said you have a contract the split should be detailed in there if theyre negating the contract line about  theyre also negating the contract so you have an out if you dont feel you can leave you can adjust your prices to accommodate the new split and make sure you are still getting what you want for your work what a previous commenter said is true though  standard where i live is so artists price accordingly i have twice in my year career had galleries take and felt like that was a huge win for me if this isnt a  exactly then youre not going to expect  standards of promotion often collectives will require a minimum effort from the artists in promoting and sales in exchange for the lower  if you have a contract for and the new split was not negotiated then your contract is void leave locally where i am is pretty standard i imagine it might vary place to place tho adding that in my area all businesses ive talked to take anywhere from to so is just extra especially for a newer business that hasnt even been open a year that hasnt even been wildly successful for months its new its not nearly busy yet im just baffled and truly disappointed no this isnt a  its a store full of just local artists goods vintage items artwork pottery jewlery fiber works etc the previous contract stated the split and we were just sent an email yesterday telling us shes the new owner and that we need to sign this new contract with the split we rent in quarters of the year basically so this contract is good from febjun i absolutely knew coming into this also stated in original contract that artists were expected to promote the store give shout outs blah blah blah but theyre supposed to have a website highlighting all of us by now showcasing our goods on social media making sure all of our items in the store are all up to par ever single day its in the contract they dont do any of that just a bunch of things that sound good on paper with no follow thru its annoying shes bringing up this contract days into the new renting quarter after ive just brought in so many new items i feel like if i went to her about these issues shed just tell me to leave because my sales arent as great as some of the other artists im so frustrated hurt and i feel stuck honestly it sounds like this isnt working out for you theyre not holding up their end and changing the terms to their benefit thats all so unprofessional in your shoes i would not sign their new contract remove my work and demand a refund less aggressive still refuse to sign new contract you have a contract already and im assuming youre paid up for your febjune rental and end your relationship in june not every business relationship is a good one youre running up against a lot of red flags here put your energy into seeking other outlets,0.9113,positive

art,do you think the finished product looks like it was made by a professional   id say its close its great but not professional im saying everything here with respect to your  with honesty to help improve no judgements its little things like how the characters are floaty and theres no weight to them the bulbous feet are an indicator as well the shading is without a true light direction the feet of the girl in the head dress are not correct to her body position also id avoid having the hair and head shape share the same line you may argue some of these are the  but they read as amateur if i were guessing youre between th and th grade artistically which means youre better than a lot of your peers and understand a lot now you just need practice and experience my initial impression is that it feels like something on deviantart where someone drew their friend group in the  of codename kids next door i think that there are some basic things that make it feel less professional the hands there is a lot of inconsistency with the number of fingers the characters have some have fingers some have inconsistent sizes of hands the char nd from the left has tiny hands with really short fingers especially compared with the woman next to them the char nd from the left also has a line from the thumb that doesnt make anatomical sense its a line youd expect if the palm was facing outward but because the thumb is closest to the body it means the palm is facing inward the char on the far left feels like hes meant to look old there is layers of emphasis put on his forehead wrinkle a harsh line and a shadow but there feels like a disconnect because the styling feels quite youthful it feels like theres not a clear decision made on the anatomy of these characters with their feetlegs the girl in the hijab has her ankles showing so we know its her body but her ankles are very wide essentially making cankles looking at the other characters from the size of their pant legs how thin their kneearea is etc it doesnt seem like their ankles should be so big ive more commonly seen this  of character with large feet and thin legs that have a clear change at the ankle your   gives me middle school vibes it looks decently welldone but not a professional  the anatomy looks off and i feel like the girl with the headdress visible hand looks weird the poses also look kinda stiff i am not good at  but i dont think it looks like a pro did it hands and feet are a bit wonky the lady wearing the hijabs left hand is good but its a bit big for me  shapes for the body and head really help to keep things proportionate when you do hands make them square like and use small triangles for fingers filling in after you like how everything is positioned it looks like its been made by a yo good for a yo not good enough for a professional  no i think you should experiment with more varying line weight and also the composition of everyone facing the viewer makes it look a little flat if you maybe angled their poses a bit and maybe put them closer together i dont have a problem with the  i think it would be good for childrens book illustrations when youre working in a very stylized way like this consistency is very important if you work on that the professionalism will go up think popeye felix the cat early disney stuff theyre all fairly simple but the consistency in  in line weight in colour profile and more is what lets you know that its professional work and it looks how it does on purpose id say youre not quite there but you can get there no offense but no it doesnt look professional lovely  this was done by a novice  for a very small budget ive never understood why people dont see the connection between budget and results and what a strange question when you ordered this work from the  did you not look at his portfolio to understand whether he was a professional or not im not a pro or anything but other than the hands i think it looks cool also i think its good to keep in mind for a muslim modesty is important its not just about covering the head but it also incorporates the coverage of the chest and ankles along with loose clothing that doesnt show off the body i know theres muslim women out there who do wear those types of clothes but the people are not the religion so it sort of gives off the wrong image of what islam really teaches you know the colour scheme is actually so good tho imo it is difficult to accept any general opinion regarding the anatomy of a character or rather its stylization when the  does not know what the anatomy of a  is,0.9865,positive
