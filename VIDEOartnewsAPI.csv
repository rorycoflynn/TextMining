It’s a simple, but very well implemented, take on a theme that we’ve seen over and over again in various forms. Two lines, or in this case timing belts, hang the bot on a wall, and two motors drive it around. Maybe a servo pulls the pen in and out, but that’s about it. The rest is motor driving and code.

We were thinking about the first such bot we’ve ever seen, and couldn’t come up with anything earlier than Hektor, a spray-painting version of this idea by [Juerg Lehni]. And since then, it’s reappeared in numerous variations.

Some implementations mount the motors on the wall, some on the bot. There are various geometries and refinements to try to make the system behave more like a simple Cartesian one, but in the end, you always have to deal with a little bit of geometry, or just relish the not-quite-straight lines. (We have yet to see an implementation that maps out the nonlinearities using a webcam, for instance, but that would be cool.) If you’re feeling particularly reductionist, you can even do away with the pen-lifter entirely and simply draw everything as a connected line, Etch-a-Sketch style. Maslow CNC swaps out the pen for a router, and cuts wood.

What I love about this family of wall-plotter bots is that none of them are identical, but they all clearly share the same fundamental idea. You certainly wouldn’t call any one of them a “copy” of another, but they’re all related, like riffing off of the same piece of music, or painting the same haystack in different lighting conditions: robot jazz, or a study in various mechanical implementations of the same core concept. The collection of all wall bots is more than the sum of its parts, and you can learn something from each one. Have you made yours yet?

Byrne, who is seventy-two, wore a buttoned-up navy polo shirt, a white wristwatch, and railroad-striped overalls. (“I thought, I have to dress like an artist today,” he said.) He finished inking a foot, said, “O.K., we’ve got hands to draw,” stood, and admired his creation: a mural showing a family of four with humanoid bodies—soft curves, rumpled clothes, neatly folded hands—and skyscrapers for heads. Byrne, who lives nearby, had been drawing in the stairwell all day. He was working from sketches he’d made, which Nate Kamp, an exhibition manager, projected onto the walls. Byrne finished the hands on a skyscraper-headed child, then asked, “What’s the next one? Oh, the one with the eyes?”

“I think the Eyes, yeah,” Kamp said.

“Whoa, boy,” Byrne said, in a here-we-go tone. He picked up a wooden stool and proceeded down to a third-floor landing.

Pace, founded by Arne Glimcher in 1960, and now run by his son Marc, opened its eight-story flagship building, designed by Bonetti/Kozerski Architecture, in 2019. Beauty and art abound—that day, Robert Indiana number sculptures adorned a sixth-floor terrace—but only recently in the stairwell. “I just thought, Oh, it would be fun to do something in the stairwell, because I take the stairs all the time, and they’re boring,” Lauren Panzo, a Pace vice-president, said. Gallerygoers often take the stairs, too; perhaps Byrne could liven them up. Panzo proposed the stairwell idea to Byrne, who had shown a whimsical tree-diagram mural and other drawings at Pace in 2022, and spot illustrations, or dingbats, in 2020. He was intrigued.

“I thought, Oh, people are really in close proximity to the walls when they go up or down,” Byrne recalled. “What if they were confronted by all these different kinds of people and creatures, each one at eye level, so when you get to the landing you’re looking right in their eyes?” This felt fun. He made some sketches, each a “little idea”: “Let’s make it a family, a couple and children, all with building heads.” Other ideas included a winking, arms-akimbo Accusatory Guy (floor 1); “two people dancing, but they’re all free-floating ovals” (floor 6.5); a strangely glamorous blob (floor 2.5); and Spiky Person (floor 3.5). “I showed the spiky drawing to someone and they said, ‘Oh, that’s a Russian bear-hunting outfit from the nineteenth century,’ ” Byrne said. He pulled up a photograph of a nail-infused leather outfit. (The costume, whose origins are mysterious, is at the Menil Collection.) Byrne’s Spiky Person is cuddlier—part hairy Ed Koren cartoon, part “Hellraiser.” He drew nine stairwell murals in all, which are now on display indefinitely.

On the landing, Kamp projected the next sketch: two faceless eyes, for “this slightly creepy or disturbing effect,” Byrne said. Marker squeaking loudly, he drew—eyes first, dark and intense, then a series of radiating lines, which evoked sunbeams, then tears, then eyelashes. “Wow,” Byrne said.

“I thought you were going to emulate bicycle spokes,” Kamp said. Byrne laughed, sounding startled. Then he drew crisscrossing lines across the original lines, which ended up looking like the Brooklyn Bridge, or a spiderweb—or, indeed, a bicycle wheel.

Byrne, a well-known cycling enthusiast, often has insights about his art after completing it. As a kid, he drew “rocket ships and spies”; as a teen, he drew surreal cartoons inspired by Zap Comix; in Talking Heads and beyond, he drew storyboards for music videos. During the pandemic, alone at home, he began drawing dingbats. “It was fun, but it was also a kind of therapy,” he said. “In retrospect, I could look at the stuff and go, Oh, look, the drawing’s about being trapped in your body or something—some body distortion.” He went on, “I thought, O.K., you’re unconsciously working through everything that’s happening during the pandemic.” He said that drawings often help to clarify ideas. “The astronomer Vera Rubin was mystified by this data she was getting from galaxies,” he said. “As soon as she did sketches, it revealed to her what was going on. She’s been credited with verifying or discovering dark matter.” He laughed. “And the late physicist Richard Feynman did these weird diagrams with arrows and squiggles and things. He found that it was much faster to think using the diagrams than to write out the whole mathematical formula for the way the electrons or whatever were moving—subatomic stuff. Once he could think with the diagram, he could go back to the math.”

Completing the Eyes, whose radiating lines extended to the wall’s edges, required some athleticism. Byrne stood on the stool, huffing like a tennis player, then lay on the floor, pushing off the wall like a swimmer. Finished, he stood, dusted off, and regarded the image. “It’s staring at me!” he said, happily. How did it feel? “Creepy!” ♦"

Grove Gallery Alexandra Johnson has sold her works for tens of thousands of pounds

Alexandra Johnson was already grieving her mother's death when Covid-19 hit the UK in 2020. As a former city trader, she had no formal art qualifications, but she nonetheless decided to manage the boredom and channel her grief by painting in her kitchen. The mother-of-three has gone on to sell her works - painted exclusively with a palette knife and spatula - for five-figure sums. Earlier this month, her portrait of Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai sold for £51,200 at the prestigious Bonhams auction house. ""I always go for powerful women, not for [their] jobs and career, just for their inner strength,"" said Johnson, who lives in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.

Grove Gallery Johnson said she found inspiration in Malala Yousafzai, a young woman who was shot by the Taliban for going to school

Johnson left her job as a trader in 2002 to become a full-time mum. She became a full-time carer for her own mother in 2017 after her cancer diagnosis, and Janet died in February 2019. The 53-year-old recalled how ""we were really bored"" when the first lockdown was imposed and she was still ""fresh in grief"". ""I don't think I'd spent five hours painting [at that point] but during lockdown the pace of life had become a lot slower,"" she told the BBC. ""I wanted to see how good I could be."" Her ""amazing"" mother served as an ""inspiration"" for those early paintings. Janet had already sacrificed her own health by giving a kidney to one of her brothers when she was 60 years old.

Grove Gallery The artist works exclusively with a palette knife and spatula to create textured paintings that explore femininity and resilience

The painter said she was forever in awe of how women supported other women in times of crisis, and she described how her work paid ""homage"" to their ""strength and grace"". She says her paintings explore memory, femininity and resilience. ""I pull from my experiences. It's personal, it's my feelings on a canvas, my favourite pieces are anything that are of my mum. ""I found it so therapeutic. ""I only do women, and I've had some really low points in my life and the women in my life just pushed me through. ""We come from a big family of powerful women."" Women wear many hats and spin many plates, she explained: ""We take on so much."""

The Walt Disney Company, Warner Brothers, Sony Pictures Animation, DreamWorks Animation, LAIKA, and more big studios have all donated an array of rare and unique pieces of animation art for interested parties to bid on.

The online auction opened this week with the hopes of aiding artists and professionals within the animation industry who are facing displacement or have lost their homes as the city of Los Angeles continues to come together and rebuild. Animation producer Don Hahn (Beauty and The Beast, Howard) spoke on behalf of the cause on Instagram:

“The animation community was hit hard by the Los Angeles fires. Now the animation world is banded together by donating artwork, priceless artwork to Sotheby’s for a very special auction to benefit an organization called AnimAID and those profits will go completely to victims of the LA fires.”

The curation of over 90 years of incredible art draws from both cinema and television, including Snow White, The Simpsons, Inside Out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, The Wild Robot, Beauty and the Beast, Avatar, and other beloved titles.

Hahn continued, “Every bid makes a difference and helps people rebuild their homes and their lives.”

The exhibition’s bidding is now ongoing and here’s a look at some of the pieces that are up for auction. Items also include film industry artist commissions, tours of the animation studios, signed posters, and more, as well as original production drawings and animation cells.

He has learned to love just about every genre of game that exists.

You’ll come across a pair of pictures (or paintings, or drawings, or whatever you want to call them) in every Blue Prince room. This pair of pictures (or paintings or drawings) serves as the basis for one of the most baffling puzzles in the game.

Our Blue Prince guide will tell why there are two pictures in every room and tell you everything you need to know about how to solve the picture puzzle, including examples, the solution, the reward.

Why are there two pictures in each room in Blue Prince?

Before we outright spell out the solution to Blue Prince’s wild picture puzzle, we’ll point you in the direction of where you can find some hints. There are a few rooms you can draft that will give you some clues:

Commissary

Study

Classroom 5

PILOT without PLOT is I. Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

In the Commissary, check the bulletin board. You’ll see one picture labeled WITH and one labeled WITHOUT. This is the biggest clue about the process of solving this puzzle. It implies you need to, for lack of a better word, “subtract” one picture from the other.

Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

In the Study, things are clarified even further. You’ll find a note asking for artwork and another with some unused examples. On the chalkboard, you’ll find a big hint about how to put it all together: a grid system that maps directly to a blank Mt. Holly blueprint, with the letter F in the spot the Entrance Hall always goes. Some small chicken scratch reads, “Face & Ace.”

Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

If you manage to draft Classroom 5, you’ll find examples of pictures on the boards around the room. But the only two hints you really need are those from the Commissary’s bulletin board and the Study’s chalkboard.

[Ed. note: Spoilers follow for the Blue Prince picture puzzle below.]

How to solve picture puzzles in Blue Prince

In most rooms, you’ll find two pictures. Generally speaking, these will be arranged with one on the left and one on the right. Your job is to find two words — one for the drawing on the left and one for the right — that differ by only one letter, and then remove the shared letters.

Let’s go through an example.

FACE without ACE is F. Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

In the Entrance Hall, you’ll see a pair of pictures framing the door on the right. Both are of hands holding playing cards. On the left is a queen, and there’s an ace on the right. But a queen is also a FACE card. So, FACE without ACE is just F.

Let’s do some more.

COAST without COST is A. Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

Some pictures are used multiple times, though, and have different meanings.

The TAG — the price tag with a ten on it — can mean TAG , TEN , or COST .

The drawing of a PLANE can mean PLANE or FLIER .

The drawing of a hand painting a moon(?) can mean PLANET or CREATE (because the hand is creating a drawing).

The drawing of a tree can be a PINE or a FIR .

The chart can mean CHART or RATE (because the arrow shows the rate of increase on the chart).

Other drawings only ever mean one thing, like the PRY bar, the TIGER or the TIERed serving dish.

DESSERT without DESERT is S. Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

Your task in each room is to look at the two pictures, and subtract the second from the first. The pictures change each day (more on this in a second), so if you get stuck, you can always try again another day.

For what it’s worth, not every room has pictures. According to our testing, green rooms like the Veranda or the Patio appear to never have pictures. Some hallways don’t have them. The Foundation doesn’t either. This is only a problem for one day at a time, though, as you’ll solve the pictures puzzle across multiple days.

Full Study chalkboard pictures puzzle solution in Blue Prince

Refer back to the grid that was on the chalkboard in the study. (You’re going to want a journal for this.) As you figure out which letters go in which boxes, you’ll slowly fill out a complete phrase.

The house in Blue Prince is arranged in a five-by-eight grid. Each day, the rooms will move around based on how you draft them, and when they do, the pictures will change. That’s because the letters are always in the same position. (This is also why the pictures in the Entrance Hall never change.) That means, no matter what room you put there, the bottom left corner will always be S.

With a bit of work and some patience, you can fill in a grid with each letter you find there. When you’re done, you’ll be able to read the message.

See below for the full solution:

The message is: IF WE COUNT SMALL GATES EIGHT DATES CRACK EIGHT SAFES.

So now what?

Picture puzzle reward in Blue Prince

Basically, this phrase is a hint that anything with code or combination on it is looking for a date. This includes the Orchard gate — “if we count small gates.” The safes it mentions can be found in rooms like the Shelter (the time lock safe counts as a date), Office, Study, Boudoir, and more.

These safes reveal red letters, which in turn fill out the backstory for Blue Prince. Want to track them all down? See our guide on all safe codes.

Historic England The paintings were created using a secco technique where pigments are applied to dry plaster

Rare 16th Century wall paintings have been revealed at a former Tudor hunting lodge. The Grotesque-style images were found behind failing plasterwork at The Ashes, in Inglewood Forest, near Ivegill, Cumbria They feature fantastical beasts and foliage arranged in decorative panels, thought to be an imitation textile design. In addition, scientific dating has confirmed that some of the earliest timbers in the building date from the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I.

Jen and Richard Arkell, the owners of The Ashes, said: ""A small fragment of wall painting - similar to that seen at nearby Dacre Hall - has been visible in the house since before we acquired the property over 20 years ago. ""However, recent work to the primary upstairs bedroom revealed much more of the composition. ""Removing old failing plaster to find these remarkable motifs and faces looking back at us is a moment we will never forget.""

Historic England The Ashes is listed as Grade II*, reflecting its exceptional historic importance

Historic England Some of the roof timbers date from the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I

Recent scientific dating using dendrochronology - a technique that analyses tree growth rings to determine age - established that the earliest part of the roof used timber, which was felled in or around the winter of 1561 to 1562. The building has been given further recognition and protection by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of Historic England. As well as the Grade II* listing for the main building, it has been awarded Grade II listing to adjoining agricultural buildings and boundary walls.

Historic England The paintings were described as a ""remarkable"" find

Myra Tolan-Smith, from Historic England, said: ""The combination of motifs discovered here is unusual even by national standards. ""Together with the newly listed farm buildings, this discovery provides remarkable insight into the evolution of a significant Tudor hunting lodge into a working farm."" Markus Campbell-Savours, MP for Penrith and Solway, said: ""It's quite clear these paintings were a remarkable find and it's wonderful news that they have now been protected as part of the building's listing. ""We can only hope that local people can enjoy them and the history of Cumbria for many years to come.""

More than 750 of these fonts have been provided via a collaboration with Monotype, which owns the licenses for Helvetica, Gotham, and Avenir.

Older versions of some of these fonts were previously available in Adobe’s Font library, but were removed in January 2023 when the creative software giant ended support for Type 1 fonts, a system that uses the outdated PostScript file format. Now, Adobe says the new fonts are integrated into Creative Cloud at no extra cost — meaning that designers won’t need to pay Monotype to license them or download them locally onto their devices.

This update should result in “fewer frustrating missing font pop-ups” according to Adobe, which users may have previously encountered when trying to use fonts that were removed, or otherwise unavailable on Adobe Fonts or Creative Cloud apps. The font expansion also includes Times New Roman, Arial, and Proxima Nova, alongside options that support alphabets used by languages like Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Hindi."

The fourth-generation Firefly Image models follow a similar precedent that OpenAI and Google have set for their chatbot releases, providing users with a choice between one model that’s suited for speed and efficiency, and another for more demanding tasks.

Adobe says that Firefly Image Model 4 is its “fastest, most controllable, and most realistic Firefly image model yet,” allowing users to generate images in up to 2K resolution with more control over style, format sizes, and camera angles. The updates from its predecessor are designed to improve the quality of image outputs while allowing them to be generated “quickly and efficiently.” For image prompts that require more “detail and realism,” Adobe is also launching Firefly Image Model 4 Ultra, which is more capable of rendering “complex scenes with small structures.”

Adobe hasn’t specified which Firefly Image 4 models were used to create these examples, but they are impressive even if the shadows on the child’s face are a little odd. Image: Adobe

The new Firefly image models are generally available now via the Firefly web app alongside Adobe’s text-to-video and text-to-vector models, which previously launched in public beta. A brand new Firefly web platform tool that’s also launching in public beta today is Firefly Boards — a FigJam-like collaborative generative AI moodboarding app that was introduced during Adobe’s Max event in October as “Project Concept.” Adobe also says that a Firefly mobile app is “coming soon” for iOS and Android devices.

The Firefly web app now also gives users access to third-party AI models when generating images or video. Users can select between OpenAI’s new GPT image model or Google’s Imagen 3 for images, or Google’s Veo 2 model for video alongside Adobe’s own AI models, with support for Luma, Pika, Runway, fal.ai, and Ideogram “coming soon,” according to Adobe.

Notice how Adobe is trying to simultaniously ebrace third-party models while also making its own as distinct as possible. Image: Adobe

The company describes these third-party offerings as being available for “experimentation” rather than publishable work, however, and clearly marks its own models as being “commercially safe.” That’s not terribly surprising given Adobe trains its AI models on public or licenced content, while OpenAI, Google, and Runway can’t claim the same.

Adobe is also rolling out a smattering of updates for its popular Creative Cloud apps. Illustrator’s generative shape fill and text to pattern tools are now generally available after being introduced in beta last year, while Photoshop is making it easier for users to make color adjustments, and automatically select details like hair, clothing, and specific facial features. The Actions panel in Photoshop is also being updated to make improved editing suggestions “based on a creator’s unique style,” and will form the foundation of the creative AI agent that Adobe is planning to build into the photo editing platform."

Children’s artistic exploration naturally knows no boundaries, with their creative impulses often resulting in permanent decorations where they’re least wanted. These artistic mishaps, while showcasing a child’s developing creativity, can lead to frustrating cleanup sessions and sometimes damaged surfaces that no amount of scrubbing can restore.

While digital tablets have revolutionized how children interact with art, most fail to capture the fundamental joy of color mixing that traditional paints provide. Current devices typically offer pre-selected color palettes or digital brushes that don’t mimic the natural blending experience of physical media. Children miss out on the magical discovery of watching blue and yellow transform into green or experiencing how adding white creates lighter tints of their favorite colors: essential learning experiences in color theory and artistic development.

Designer: Yifeeling Design

The HueHub concept reimagines digital art for young creators by combining tablet technology with the tactile experience of traditional painting. Unlike standard tablets, HueHub features a specialized layout with a main drawing canvas and an innovative side panel containing three primary color blocks of red, yellow, and blue, plus a dedicated mixing area where children can blend these colors to create endless combinations. This thoughtful design bridges the gap between digital convenience and traditional artistic discovery.

What makes this concept truly special is how it simulates a painter’s palette experience in the digital realm. Children can “dip” their stylus into virtual paint, mix colors in the dedicated tray, and apply their custom-created hues to their artwork, all without the mess of traditional paints. The software would recreate realistic paint behaviors like blending and texture, helping children understand color relationships while keeping floors and furniture pristine. Parents get peace of mind while children enjoy the full sensory experience of creating art.

Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the HueHub concept is its color-capturing stylus that could “pick up” colors from real-world objects. Imagine a child fascinated by the exact shade of a flower petal or autumn leaf being able to capture that precise color for their digital masterpiece. This feature would create a meaningful connection between digital art and the physical world, encouraging children to observe their surroundings more closely and bring those observations into their creative work.

The HueHub concept represents a thoughtful approach to children’s digital art tools that respects how children naturally learn about color and creativity. By combining the cleanliness and convenience of digital media with the experiential learning of traditional painting, this device could transform how young artists develop their skills. Although just a concept, the technologies that could make this possible already exist and can paint, pardon the pun, a future where technology enhances rather than replaces the fundamental artistic experiences that help children understand their colorful world."

She creates warm, odd and charming characters and tableaus in sustainable Yorkshire spun and dyed wool. Having originally studied illustration, Annie got her hands on a knitting machine to keep her fingers busy. “I’ve always liked ‘applied illustration’ in that I’ve always enjoyed putting drawings onto physical objects rather than on paper,” she explains. She’s also dabbled in screen printing, papier-mache, clay and painting furniture. “I think knitting is just another way to physically make something out of your drawings,” Annie says, “a tactile, cosy and useful form for my drawings to take.”

The drawings themselves – featuring friendly (sometimes uncanny) characters, like conniving devils and endearing animal faces – are both familiar and unusual, finding a tender middle ground between likeable and off-kilter. Albeit, with eyes that seem to follow you around the room. This is due to Annie’s childhood obsession with illustrative characters, the likes of Richard Scarry’s creations, alongside her more contemporary interests, including kids’ clothing patterns and knitting books. “I had some great books growing up, and as a child I thought ‘children’s book illustrator’ was one of the main jobs that adults had,” Annie says. “As I grew up and realised this wasn’t the case, I was still drawn to illustration though, purely because it looked fun.” This laid-back yet earnest approach is evident in the mischievous characters, scenes and landscapes she shapes. “Whenever I’m drawing, I want the characters to look cheeky or fun,” Annie ends. “I don’t take the drawing part too seriously and quite like leaning into bad or messy drawings.”"

When you finally draft the Gallery — and it can take a while — you’ll find four paintings by the game’s dedicatee, Christopher Manson. The names of each painting are blank and there’s a set of frames next to each of them. When you use the frames to correctly name each painting, the two chests in the middle of the room will unlock.

The contents of the paintings give you the hints you need to solve them with a bit of thought. If you look around, you’ll notice that the painting titles are five, six, seven, and eight letters long. We’ll take them in that order.

Thick Gallery painting solution in Blue Prince

Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

The first painting — the one with a five-letter title — has the word “thick” on a pond with a pair of handcuffs and a spotlight. Most of it is a distraction. What you’re really looking at is just the word, specifically the last letter.

The word “thick” is spelled with thick letters except for that last thin K. And that’s your answer: THINK.

That title is also a clue to the rest — they’re all related to (synonyms of) “think.”

The six-letter painting is of two mirrored wagons full of red things — the wagon itself, a rose, a stop sign, an apple, and a fire hydrant. On the right, a huge letter P is on the wagon.

Taking it all together, it’s a P ON RED things, but the side the P is on is mirrored. And if you mirror the RED part of that description, you get the answer: PONDER.

The seven-letter painting is mostly just eyeballs, but there are a few words as well that will help you find the answer: ACTUAL on the sign, GENU on the bottle (as in “genuine”), and a table made of the word VERI (the Latin root for “truth”).

All of those words are synonyms for REAL. Add all of those EYES to that for the answer: REALIZE.

[Author’s note: I’m just now realizing, while writing this, that the wine bottle and glass might be a play on the phrase “In vino veritas.”]

The final puzzle’s title has eight letters. There’s an infinity symbol in a room with some boxes around it, a painting on the wall, and a rug on the floor.

For the solution, you have to take all of the parts of the painting together. In the ROOM, there’s a bunch of things that all rhyme (or contain) IN — a fIN, some pINs, a skIN on the floor, and bINs labeled with sINs. The INfINity symbol is also a sideways EIGHT.

Put it all together and you get ROOM+IN+EIGHT or RUMINATE.

The first chest is just a normal chest, so it will have coins or gems inside. The second chest, however, will include Key 8. When you use that key on a locked door that leads to rank 8, it’ll draft Room 8 (much like how the Secret Garden Key works)."

Hey design friends! Let's talk type. For the longest time, fonts felt pretty fixed, right? You picked a weight, and that was that. But things are shifting, literally. Variable fonts have opened up a whole new playground for graphic design, letting type stretch, bend, and morph in ways we couldn't easily do before.

From Pixels to Paper

One studio diving headfirst into this dynamic world is Overnice. They cooked up a variable font called Squeezy, embracing all the cool possibilities – think type that adapts and animates. They even built a colorful interactive experience around it, which snagged an honor from Awwwards. Pretty cool stuff for the screen.

But the folks at Overnice thought, why should digital have all the fun? That's the question that sparked their Squeezy Variable Posters project. They decided to take the fluidity and vibrancy of their Squeezy font and translate it into tangible graphic design artifacts you can hang on your wall.

The Squeezy Poster Lowdown

So, what did they create? A series of limited-edition posters. Each design takes a letter or concept – like ""Gentle Gangster,"" ""Exotic Xenos,"" ""Vivid Vintage,"" or ""Kinetic Kraken"" – and brings it to life using the Squeezy font. The visuals play with form and overlapping colors, showcasing how the font can squeeze and expand.

The designs feel modern yet have a touch of retro charm, thanks to the color palettes and the smooth, expressive lines of the typeface. It’s a great example of how variable font technology can inspire fresh graphic design aesthetics. They didn't just type out words; they crafted visual statements where the letterforms themselves are the main event.

These aren't just quick prints, either. Overnice went for quality: museum-standard Giclee prints on hefty 300gsm matte fine art paper. Each one is a limited run of 25, making them pretty exclusive pieces. It’s a commitment to bringing that digital flexibility into a high-quality physical format. They measure 40x50 cm, ready to make a statement.

Why It Matters for Graphic Design

This project sits right at the intersection of typography, technology, and print design. It’s more than just posters; it’s a physical exploration of digital potential. Variable fonts offer incredible flexibility – adjusting weight, width, or other attributes dynamically. Seeing Overnice apply this to print reminds us that innovation isn't confined to screens.

The Squeezy posters demonstrate how graphic design can leverage new tools to create compelling visual narratives. The way the letters stretch and compress isn't just functional; it's expressive, adding personality and dynamism to the compositions. It pushes us to think about how type can perform visually, beyond just legibility.

For designers, it’s inspiring to see studios like Overnice experimenting and bridging the digital-physical gap. It challenges us to explore the capabilities of the tools we have and think about how they can translate across different mediums.

Check Them Out

These posters are a beautiful example of contemporary graphic design pushing boundaries. It’s exciting to see variable fonts moving beyond web applications and finding a place in print and physical products.

BBC/Jamie Niblock Museum staff believe the binding and corners of this book are made using the skin of 19th Century murderer William Corder

The cover of a book held at a Suffolk museum was recently found to be made from the skin of a man hanged for a notorious murder almost 200 years ago. William Corder was convicted of killing a woman in 1827, which shocked Georgian Britain and became known as the Red Barn Murder. Curators at Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds realised the book, which was on a bookshelf in an office, had been overlooked but it has now gone on display. It had been donated decades ago by a family with close connections to the surgeon who anatomised Corder's body. So what do we know of William Corder and the murder, which fascinates to this day?

Who were William and his victim Maria?

Getty Images William Corder's legacy lives on, as the Red Barn Murder continues to enthrall

William was from a middle-class family of tenant farmers in the village of Polstead, between Ipswich and Sudbury, at the turn of the 19th Century. At the age of 22, when he and Maria Marten became lovers, he was the head of the Corder family and had a reputation as a ladies' man. Maria, who was 24 and lived at home with her mole-catcher father, a stepmother, sister, and her young son, may have seen young William as a means of escape. In 1827, William came up with a plan to elope, telling Maria to meet him at the Red Barn on the Corders' farm, then run off to Ipswich to get the banns for their wedding. Maria was not seen again and William disappeared.

What happened next?

William eventually left Suffolk and wrote to the Marten family to say he had eloped with Maria to the Isle of Wight. In reality, he was holed up just outside London and Maria was buried at the lovers' rendezvous, having been shot in the neck. Almost a year later, legend states, Ann Marten had a dream her stepdaughter was dead and at the Red Barn. Maria's father dug with his ""mole spud"" spade and found his daughter's remains. As a manhunt ensued, a newspaper editor flagged that he knew of a William Corder. ""He is effectively on the run, and the theory is he is lonely, and puts an advert in the newspaper asking for a new wife,"" says Dan Clarke, a heritage officer at Moyse's Hall Museum. It holds many Red Barn Murder artefacts, including two books covered in Corder's skin. The authorities traced Corder, who denied any knowledge of Maria, but had a letter from Polstead telling him her body had been found.

The trial and public hanging

Getty Images William Corder's hanging attracted a mass of people who sang and danced

Corder was brought to Bury St Edmunds on 10 counts of murder, each based on a different theory about Maria's demise and to strengthen the chance of a conviction. In his defence he claimed Maria had killed herself, thereby accusing the dead woman of a capital crime. He was found guilty after a two-day trial, and in a final confession said he had accidentally shot Maria during an argument. It is estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people came to see him hanged outside the prison at the stroke of noon on 11 August 1828. Later that day, people queued to file past his body at the town's Shire Hall. ""There were so many people, the story goes they couldn't get him outside the prison, so they had to hit a hole in the side of the building and create a temporary scaffold,"" said Mr Clarke. ""There would have been singing and dancing, you would have been able to buy a section of the rope afterwards."" Polstead became a tourist attraction, the Red Barn and even Maria's gravestone chipped away by souvenir-hunters.

Corder's legacy

William Corder's death mask is at Moyse's Hall and Norwich Castle

Public intrigue in the Red Barn Murder sparked books, plays and music, and it permeates the true crime culture to this day. At a distance of two centuries, it has become a ripping yarn, the true story clouded in legend. It is probably fuelled, in part, by being able to stand face-to-face with Corder's image, his eyes shut and his nostrils flared. His death mask is held at Moyse's Hall and Norwich Castle. For many years, until it eventually began to fall apart, his skeleton was used to teach medical students at West Suffolk Hospital. Disturbingly, two books were covered in his skin and part of the man's scalp, with ear included, was kept as a gruesome ornament. All are at Moyse's Hall. Terry Deary, who created Horrible Histories, believes Corder has been ""maligned"" with Maria incorrectly portrayed as an innocent young maiden. Moyse's Hall said it would redress the focus on Corder with a future exhibition which will shine a light on woman victims in Suffolk history, including Maria. Heritage assistant Abbie Smith said 80% of its visitors were ""desperate"" to know about the Red Barn Murder. ""How it ended is a big factor, it was such a spectacle and people are going to be drawn to it. ""It's a gory, grotty one, so people seem to like that - rather worryingly.""

What more do we know about the books?

The first book of the two books is about the trial. It was written by the journalist Jay Curtis and the title on the spine is ""Trial of W Corder"". There is an annotation inside written by the surgeon who performed William Corder's dissection, George Creed, which states that it was the surgeon himself who tanned the skin and bound the book in the year 1838. The second book is thought to be the same edition, but the spine reads ""Polstead – William Corder"". This book was donated to the museum by a family which has close ties to George Creed, who he left a number of his possessions to.

After kicking off in January 2021, the era is wrapping up soon with the June release of the final book in its third phase, Charles Soule’s Trials of the Jedi.

But what lies ahead for Star Wars readers? Lucasfilm Publishing’s Star Wars Celebration panel, “Stories From a Galaxy Far, Far Away” was a good place to start for some answers. The Tokyo panel teased “the latest publishing news from the prequel trilogy to the sequel trilogy and beyond, including news on the grand finale of The High Republic,” with Adam Christopher, Tessa Gratton, Marc Guggenheim, Lydia Kang, Ethan Sacks, Phil Szostak, Alyssa Wong, and Marvel’s C.B. Cebulski on hand to make the announcements.

The biggest reveal was something on the more visual side: an Andor art book is coming!

Here’s the description from the official press release: “The Art of Star Wars: Andor (The Complete Series) takes fans behind the scenes of the critically acclaimed Disney+ Star Wars series set in the early days of the Rebellion and following Rogue One‘s Cassian Andor as he grows from thief to rebel spy.”

“Interviews conducted by The Art of Star Wars: The Mandalorian author and Lucasfilm creative art manager Phil Szostak with Academy Award-nominated showrunner/head writer Tony Gilroy, Lucasfilm art department ‘visualists,’ and key crew and creatives will give an in depth look at every facet of the creative process that brought this unique Star Wars story to the screen. With hundreds of stunning ship and vehicle designs, character studies, weapons, gadgets, storyboards, and so much more, this book is the ultimate visual companion to Andor.”

The bad news is that The Art of Star Wars: Andor will set you back $50, and won’t be out until March 2026.

The panel today also included more discussion of the final High Republic book, Trials of the Jedi, mentioned above. Other new titles announced: comics Star Wars: The High Republic – The Battle of Eriadu and Star Wars: The High Republic – The Beacon; the Jecki and Yord-focused Padawan adventure The Acolyte: The Crystal Crown; another art book, Industrial Light & Magic: 50 Years of Innovation; and comics Star Wars: Hyperspace Stories – Codebreaker, for Poe Dameron fans; and new issues of Star Wars: Legacy of Vader; and Star Wars: Jedi Knights.

Last week, ahead of the panel itself, Lucasfilm Publishing dropped some early news about upcoming releases—including Adam Christopher’s Star Wars: Master of Evil Darth Vader novel; lavish two-volume art book Doug Chiang: The Cinematic Legacy and the Star Wars Legacy; Halloween-themed Star Wars: I Find Your Lack of Candy Disturbing, featuring art by Jeffrey Brown; and Disney+ behind-the-scenes deep dives The Art of Star Wars: The Acolyte and The Acolyte Visual Guide. Other previously announced releases include an updated new edition of Star Wars: The Blueprints, as well as an updated new edition of Star Wars: Women of the Galaxy.

But that’s not all! At another Lucasfilm Publishing panel earlier in the day, “Manga Mania!”, the company also shared what’s coming from that arm of the company. That includes a Kickstarter initiative for a two-volume The Art of Star Wars: A New Hope—The Manga; manga adaptations of Star Wars: Thrawn and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order; and aspiring Jedi tale Star Wars: Path of the Lightsaber."

An accomplished wood engraver, illustrator, and maker of patterned papers, she had already produced an impressive body of creative work, but this was the first time she’d attempted a book. “I want to write my life while I am still happy,” she admits toward the end of the manuscript that was eventually published, many decades later, as Long Live Great Bardfield, & Love to You All: The Autobiography of Tirzah Garwood. Living in Essex with her husband, the artist Eric Ravilious, and their three young children, Garwood was recovering from an emergency mastectomy following a breast cancer diagnosis. Her convalescence had given her the chance to start writing in earnest, which, she explains, “otherwise I should never have had time to do.”

How to find the time had long been a pressing question for Garwood, as it has been for so many mothers who are also artists. “I always regret that I stopped working because it is difficult with a house to think about,” she wrote to a newly married friend in 1936, encouraging her not to abandon her own painting. Yet in “Tirzah Garwood: Beyond Ravilious,” an immaculate show at London’s Dulwich Picture Gallery, Garwood emerges as an artist who who adapted her practice to her life, painting and modeling her home, her children, scenes from local village life, and the buildings and people that were the backdrop of her daily routines. Even before she was a wife and mother she was drawn to depicting household scenes. Her wood engraving Spring (1927) shows two women cleaning a bedroom, one down on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floor, the other plumping a pillow; the illustration Commercial Traveller (circa 1927) has a salesman exhibiting his wares on the doorstep to an audience of women and children.

Private Collection Tirzah Garwood: The Wife, 1929

But as the show’s curator, James Russell, emphasizes in its comprehensive and elegant catalogue, the “main aim” of the exhibition is to recognize Garwood as more than simply “Mrs. Eric Ravilious.” That was how The Times identified her in their review of the Arts Council Gallery’s June 1952 memorial exhibition of her work, a year after her death from cancer at forty-two. Originally held in the spring at the Towner Art Gallery in Eastbourne, the memorial show generated enough popular demand that it reopened later in the summer in London, but thereafter Garwood’s work was largely forgotten. Her memoir, which she left unfinished at her death, remained unpublished until 2012, when Fleece Press issued an edition edited and with notes by her daughter Anne Ullmann (reprinted in 2016 as Long Live Great Bardfield: The Autobiography of Tirzah Garwood by Persephone Books). Little of her work made it into other shows. Not only is “Tirzah Garwood: Beyond Ravilious” the first major exhibition of her work, many of the eighty-odd pieces on display have never before been shown to the public and are loaned from private collections.

Anyone who thinks they’re familiar with Garwood’s art will surely find the exhibition a revelation. For every piece that’s recognizable—some of her more oft-reproduced wood engravings, for example, or the marbled papers that she made during her marriage to Ravilious, which the Times praised as “among the most delicate and the prettiest that have ever been produced”—four or five are utterly new. Most striking is the breadth and diversity of the work on display: not just those engravings and papers but embroidery, watercolors, oil paintings, two-dimensional paper collages of what amounts to an entire village of houses and buildings in box frames, a patchwork quilt, pencil and ink-wash drawings.

And yet it all coheres as the oeuvre of a single artist. Garwood paid consistently close attention to detail—whether in the precise draughtsmanship of Six Eggs (circa 1945), a color pencil illustration for a children’s book, or in the Wes Anderson–like symmetry of her boxed houses. One can also trace an increasingly prominent note of whimsy. The elegant meticulousness of her early wood engravings—the medium in which she first proved her talents but which she put aside to devote more of her attention to marriage and motherhood—gives way to landscapes and gatherings stranger and more mysterious.

Garwood was born in 1908, the third of five children of a blonde beauty from Croydon and a royal engineer with what his daughter described as “a romantic nature.” She was christened Eileen Lucy, but when her grandmother sent a letter shortly after her birth inquiring after “Little Tirtia,” she quickly acquired the nickname “Tirzah.” The family moved often due to Colonel Garwood’s military career, but when Tirzah was sixteen they settled permanently in Eastbourne, a Victorian resort town on England’s southeast coast, where she attended the local art school.

There she met Ravilious, a recent graduate of the design school at London’s prestigious Royal College of Art, now teaching in Eastbourne. Five years Garwood’s senior, Ravilious was among a group of young artists identified by their tutor Paul Nash as an “outbreak of talent.” Nash had taught his protégé wood engraving, a medium Ravilious quickly excelled in, and now Garwood too proved a natural: just a year after she made her first piece, her quartet The Four Seasons (1927) was accepted for the annual exhibition of the Society of Wood Engravers (to which Ravilious had been elected in 1920). The recognition helped her convince her parents that she should move to London to study at the Central School of Arts and Crafts.

Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Table-Turning, 1928

Garwood arrived in the city in 1928, installing herself in a room in the attic of the Ladies’ National Club in Kensington. Her recollections of boarding house life in Long Live Great Bardfield have the flavor of a Muriel Spark novel. The building is inhabited by spinsters, retired nurses, and women of modest but independent means. “One middle-aged woman had apparently no occupation,” she writes. “She just lived and read novels from the library in an unending stream.” Garwood, by contrast, had come to London with the hope of being able to earn her own living. She recalls dancing “round and round the room with joy” on the “wonderful, wonderful evening” that she was given her first job, with the BBC: in 1929 she designed the crest for the Radio Times, the UK’s weekly television listings guide, for which she went on to produce regular work on commission.

Garwood and Ravilious married in 1930. Initially wedded life made little difference to her work. She had, she admitted in her memoirs, not “learned anything that was at all useful in a house” in the course of her education, and when they were newlyweds Eric was the more accomplished cook. Garwood did design work for the Curwen, Golden Cockerel, and Kynoch presses and assisted her husband with some of his projects, from doing the fiddly work of cutting away the white backgrounds of the wood engravings he was making for an edition of Twelfth Night to helping him paint murals at the Midland Hotel, Morecambe, in 1933—not that such endeavors were publicly credited to her at the time.

In 1931 the couple moved to the village of Great Bardfield, in Essex, to share a house with Ravilious’s college friend Edward Bawden and his wife, Charlotte. What the four of them established later grew into a larger, loosely connected community known today as the Great Bardfield Artists. In his group biography, Ravilious & Co. (2017), Andy Friend explains that living and working side-by-side yielded an especially “rich artistic haul” for the two men. Their relationship was equal parts encouragement and healthy competition. They tried to outdo one another by rising earlier in the day, or painting outdoor scenes in the rain, cold, or blistering heat.

Private collection A sheet of marbled paper by Tirzah Garwood, 1934–1941

In the background of this rambunctious working partnership was a less frequently cited collaboration between Garwood and Charlotte, who began experimenting together with paper marbling in the winter of 1934. Less often noted, too, is the mutual influence between Garwood’s output in that medium—the elaborate designs and tints she managed to achieve—and the pattern-making in her husband’s landscapes from these years, or the color layering in his lithography. One of Russell’s ingenious decisions is to position such pieces—the show includes eleven of Ravilious’s works—side by side. The free-flowing forms in Garwood’s marbled papers and her use of organic, natural ink tones (sepia, rust-red, black, blue and gray, the softest pink) echo the shapes and colors of her husband’s The Potato Field (1941) and Vicarage in Winter (1935). Look closely at the latter next to Garwood’s papers and the crosshatching of pastel tones in the sky becomes more obvious as a kind of pattern work.

During their years in Essex both Garwood and Ravilious had romantic and sexual entanglements with other people. He was the instigator, and his first infidelities caused Garwood much pain, but she took solace in her liaison with John Aldridge, a friend of both hers and Ravilious’s and one of the leading artists in their Great Bardfield set. “We made love so perfectly together that it was impossible to think of it as wrong or harmful to anyone else. But we both knew it couldn’t go on indefinitely,” she writes in her memoirs. And it didn’t—Aldridge was also married and had no intention of leaving his wife. Garwood’s and Ravilious’s relationship seems to have survived because neither believed they belonged exclusively to the other. “My loving them,” Garwood writes of the men in her life, “was the important thing and not my possessing them.” In large part this attitude was possible because she and Ravilious so seriously acknowledged the weight of their art.

The gallery’s shape—a pair of compact yet high-ceilinged square rooms and a pair of longer, leaner galleries that run between them—favors exhibitions with a linear narrative, which suits “Beyond Ravilious” well. The first room introduces us to Garwood’s early work. Her wood engravings dominate—some already familiar, others entirely new. Table Turning (1928) uses the medium’s stark black-and-white contrasts to evocative effect: the extraordinary detail of the fabrics worn by the séance’s participants—beading, fringing, gleaming silk and taffeta—momentarily distracts you before you find yourself drawn into the deep dark hole of the table at the center of the image. Hanging by the side of Yawning, a 1928 wood engraving of a woman in a state of morning deshabille, is a colorful, similarly intricate embroidery of the same title from the 1930s. Not only are Garwood’s stitches faultless, down to each individual hairpin discarded on the woman’s dressing table, she also achieves depth and texture by using different fabrics alongside the needlework. From beneath the woman’s robe peeks the lacy hem of her nightgown, and the tousled end of her braided hair is a fluffed-up skein of wool. The fringing of the runner on the dressing table is a fine cream appliqué.

The central galleries showcase Garwood’s talent for working in a range of media: another gorgeous needlework embroidery, of a woman watering her vegetable garden; a quilt; marbled papers; collages; miniature boxed and wall-mounted doll-house-like constructions of village buildings, complete with moving parts. Here too the detail is in the layering of materials. Snipped lace curtains. A leaf print repurposed as a climbing plant, winding its way up a paper trellis. Stonework and miniature cottage loaves on display in the window of a bakery fashioned out of Sankey’s Pyruma (a cement-like substance originally intended to repair fireplaces, but often used by model-makers). Strips of dark forest-green corduroy as a thick hedge—left over, we imagine, from a homemade pair of children’s dungarees; Garwood was a skilled dressmaker who regularly made clothes for both herself and her children.

Garwood’s first child with Ravilious, John, was born in 1935. The demands on her time affected her work, even as motherhood also clearly inspired her. Four years later, in August 1939, she gave birth to a second son, James. War was declared with Germany the following month, and Ravilious was commissioned as an Official War Artist. Their final child, Anne, arrived in 1941, a year before Garwood suffered a series of tragedies.

First came her cancer diagnosis and treatment, followed shortly thereafter by a therapeutic abortion. (Her doctors considered this unplanned pregnancy inadvisable because it had only been three months since her mastectomy.) In her memoirs she remembers that she was discharged from the hospital still bleeding and too uncomfortable for her and Ravilious to make love, much to their mutual frustration. A week later Ravilious left for the front in Iceland, where, that September, he was killed in action when his plane disappeared over the Atlantic. Neither it nor any survivors were ever found. He was thirty-nine years old.

Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Springtime of Flight, 1950

When he chose to leave, it hadn’t just been out of patriotic duty: he had long wished to paint Iceland’s extraordinary light. “I wondered why I had urged him to go,” Garwood remembers of the morning he left, “and realised that it was because I accepted the fact that his work was more important to him than me and I appreciated this attitude.”

*

Garwood mourned her husband’s loss deeply, but it did not destroy her. The exhibition gives a potent sense of something shifting in her artistic practice in the years after Ravilious’s death: a release of light and color in the midst of war, widowhood, and illness, but also a return to the playfulness of her past and the visual landscape of her childhood. Her work from this period draws on elements of traditional Victoriana, as in the large and opulent scrapbook she kept throughout her life: tin soldiers, découpage, cigarette cards, dolls’ houses.

Toward the end of her life Garwood turned to oils. In the nine years she had left, she married again—to Henry Swanzy, a pioneering BBC producer whose radio program Caribbean Voices introduced writers such as V.S. Naipul and Derek Walcott to the British public—raised her children, and kept working. Anne’s memories of coming home from school during these years are rich with “the smell of oil paint and turpentine,” her mother “reluctantly” finishing work and cleaning her brushes.

In 1948 Garwood’s cancer returned, now advanced and incurable. From the hospital bed in London where she was receiving palliative treatment, she wrote to a friend that she’d been “luckier than most people apart from wishing that I could have had more time for getting on with painting.” Oil on canvas had by then become the sole focus of her creative efforts, perhaps due to necessity—she was confined to her bed and no longer capable of the labor that much of her prior work required.

Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Erskine Returning at Dawn, 1950

The show’s final room is devoted to the oils she executed during her last twelve months, all shot through with a sense of the magical and surreal. The obvious visual comparison is the work of Leonora Carrington, but I’m more inclined to think of the aesthetics of Barbara Comyns. Her own paintings aren’t a patch on Garwood’s, but her charming and strange midcentury novels—which are possessed of a unique kitchen-sink-style magical realism—have long struck me as sharing DNA with Long Live Great Bardfield. Like Comyns, Garwood reports the story of her life crisply and matter-of-factly, conjuring up the essences of the people around her and the intensity of her experiences in swift, simple images, but always with a keen eye for eccentrics and capriciousness. When she and Ravilious first lived together, she writes in one memorable passage, they had a maid who, when she worked at a hotel, had once “accidentally shut a cat in the oven but she smelled his singeing fur in the nick of time.” It’s like something out of Comyns’s novel The Vet’s Daughter (1959). Both women’s storytelling, whether visual or verbal, marries practicality and whimsy, the sinister and the comic. They each retain a strong sense of innocence, often in the face of significant suffering.

Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Snowmen at Hedingham, 1950

Garwood’s visual otherworldliness isn’t quite the dreamlike fantasy of Carrington’s visions, but rather the stuff of fairy tales and childlike sensitivities: a homecoming to the world of “fairies and flowers” she spent hours painting as a child. Dolls and other toys—train sets and building blocks—feature heavily. So do animals beloved by infants—cats, ducks and geese, even a tortoise. In Snowmen at Hedingham (1950), a smiling family of snow-people stand in front of a warmly glowing red-brick garden wall: mother, father, and child. It makes for a striking contrast with her earlier Snow Woman (1938), an ink and wash creation of notably duller monochrome tones, the air thick and gray.

While she was painting these final works, Garwood knew she was dying. It’s impossible to see Hide and Seek (1950) without feeling the weight of her mortality. It looks down on the garden of her and Swanzy’s house in London’s Primrose Hill, her children rendered as flashes of color among the high green grass, dense shrubbery, and trees, already at a distance from their mother alone in her sickbed upstairs. She was also often in a lot of pain. Nevertheless her friend Olive Cook related that she she declared this period “the happiest year of her life,” amazing everyone with what Cook described to Anne as “determination, courage and unquenchable gaiety,” letting her work absorb her completely.

Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Hide and Seek, 1950

Even as her daily life contracted, as the exhibition’s final room testifies, her imaginative world was expanding. As Jennifer Higgie notes in her excellent catalogue essay, Garwood always admired what she described as “the charming distortions of perspectives and proportion, the fantasy and the unexpected beauties of colour that young children produce in their pictures.” Erskine Returning at Dawn (1950) shows the family cat marching home from a night on the prowl, huge and magisterial, taking up the entire foreground of the canvas, throwing off the perspective of the trees on the horizon in the background. In Charlotte’s Doll (1950) the subject of the piece has been posed among a backdrop of tulips that tower above her—a little Victorian explorer deep in an uncharted, exotic jungle. By comparison, in Doll’s House Room (1950) it’s Garwood and Swanzy who’ve been transformed into tiny toy figurines.

Swanzy features more often on the exhibition’s walls than Ravilious, who appears only in The Vegetable Garden (1929), surveying his crops, hefty marrows tucked under his arms. (Garwood, by comparison, appears regularly in his work.) Perhaps Swanzy’s presence in these scenes simply speaks to his presence in Garwood’s now reduced domestic world, but it also suggests a lack of competition in her second marriage. Husband and wife each had their separate spheres of work, as Garwood acknowledged in her official-looking Portrait of Henry Swanzy (1947), in which he’s sat on a red sofa, dressed smartly in a suit and tie, a copy of the periodical African Affairs beside his right elbow, above which, in the background of the image, a globe sits atop a bookcase and three carved wooden African figurines stand on the mantlepiece.

Private collection Tirzah Garwood: Spanish Lady, 1950

To see this impressive intellectual shrunk into a toy-sized figure in Doll’s House Room makes for a striking contrast. On first glance it looks like an innocent, benign scene suitable for a nursery wall, but on closer inspection, there’s something decidedly uncanny about this image of humans rendered helplessly inanimate. I’m reminded of Garwood’s eerie early wood engraving, Cat into Wife (circa 1928), in which an otherwise ordinary, cosy, hearthside domestic scene is transmuted into one of terror, the monstrous half-feline/half-human figure sprawled on the floor, the shocked husband watching on in horror. Other colorful, cheerful surfaces in these late works also belie a sense of menace: Weewak’s Kitten (1950), with its ominous black pansies and creepy black cat lurking in the grass, or Suffragette’s House (1951), in which dancing matchstick dolls circle the building like pagans performing their rites in a folk-horror film.

On first glance, Spanish Lady (1950), the final painting on display, suggests a more serene, sublime metamorphosis. A Victorian clay water bottle in the shape of a crinolined lady with a long, elegant neck, not unlike Garwood’s, stands next to a bed of spring flowers, glowing in a softly moonlit garden. It’s widely acknowledged as a kind of self-portrait in disguise. Garwood has transformed herself into an angelic, eternal statue. Yet the image is strangely haunting, not entirely tranquil. One is reminded that a life was cut short—that an artist was silenced in her prime."

St. Lucia’s Sugar Beach Is an Art Lover’s Paradise

Art and luxury don’t always often share the same level of intent. Luxury often focuses on opulence and exclusivity, while art is more about creativity and thoughtfulness. But at Sugar Beach, A Viceroy Hotel in St. Lucia, the two are inseparable. And the resort’s long-awaited opening of its massive new villa, named “Spice of Life,” signals a deliberate effort to integrate contemporary works into high-end hospitality, making it one of the most ambitious private accommodations in the Caribbean.

The 35,000-square-foot residence, designed by Botelho Wood Architects in Bermuda, accommodates up to 18 guests and features art from Yayoi Kusama, Daniel Arsham, Jeff Koons, KAWS, Julian Opie and Tom Sachs—just to start. Unlike properties where artwork is an afterthought, the villa incorporated these pieces from the outset of construction.

“One of the things that makes this villa different is that it wasn’t just decorated with art—the entire space was built around it,” says James Wyndham, managing director of Sugar Beach. “Instead of selecting pieces to complement an existing structure, the architecture and interiors were planned to enhance and highlight the collection.”

This approach extends beyond the villa with more than 180 pieces situated across the larger property. (The Spice of Life villa has more than 110 inside on its own.) The artworks can be found not only in common areas but also in other guest accommodations. Imagine seeing a Damien Hirst painting in your bathroom. At Sugar Beach, that’s the norm, not the exception.

Guests can not only get up-close-and-personal with these multimillion-dollar pieces, but they can also take themselves on a self-guided art tour. Each installation has a blink-and-you-miss-it placard with a QR code, which loads a description of the artwork in the phone’s default browser. (And Wi-Fi is free and abundant throughout the property with little to no hassle.)

The significance of incorporating art at this scale raises questions about how high-end hospitality is changing. Luxury is often synonymous with excess, so some hotels and resorts have sought to redefine what exclusivity means. Rather than relying on traditional displays of opulence, Sugar Beach’s management sees artistic curation as an extension of cultural engagement.

The art collection is positioned alongside a focus on locally sourced materials from St. Lucia and around the Caribbean. Wyndham notes that the region is recognized for its skilled carpenters and stone masons, and thus the villa incorporated these techniques and materials into its construction. Hardwood and stone are used throughout, aligning with broader efforts to maintain a connection to St. Lucia’s architectural traditions.

Sustainability measures include rainwater collection systems for irrigation and bathroom use. The resort also has over 300 solar panels contributing to its energy supply and solar-powered street lights that provide assistance to local fishermen.

By Rachel King

“St. Lucia as a whole is still developing its recycling and environmental initiatives,” Wyndham acknowledges. “That being said, there is a strong commitment to making progress in this area, and we are very much aligned with that effort.”

Sugar Beach has also positioned itself as an active participant in community engagement. The resort is one of the largest supporters of the nearby Soufrière Hospital and has funded multiple educational programs in the area. By sourcing materials and labor locally, the property aims to ensure that its investment in design and infrastructure benefits the surrounding economy.

The integration of art within private residences and hotels is not unique to Sugar Beach. Other high-end hotels and resorts around the world have taken similar approaches. The Rosewood São Paulo, for example, incorporates over 450 commissioned pieces by Brazilian artists in the Philippe Starck-designed hotel, presenting itself as both a hotel and a functioning gallery space. Similarly, Le Royal Monceau Raffles Paris has a contemporary art gallery onsite, open to guests, art collectors and general visitors alike with exclusive pieces and frequent art shows, with even more pieces from the hotel’s private collection scattered throughout the lobby and hallways. And the gallery at the Fairmont Pacific Rim in Vancouver rotates exhibitions quarterly, showcasing primarily Canadian contemporary artists.

The focus on art and sustainability reflects a shift in expectations for luxury hospitality. A 2021 study found that 81% of travelers planned to choose sustainable accommodation options in the coming year, indicating a growing desire for more meaningful experiences. Travelers are increasingly seeking environments that are immersive rather than purely ornamental. The presence of original, high-profile works offers a differentiating factor in a competitive market, particularly as hotels move away from neutral, standardized designs.

Courtesy of Viceroy

“We’re not just modern luxury, we’re young luxury,” Wyndham says, emphasizing targeting a younger demographic. This emphasis on contemporary art reflects a broader generational shift in the definition of high-end travel. For many, a luxury stay is no longer about the predictability of five-star service but about an atmosphere that fosters creativity and conversation.

“By definition, art is intended to elicit emotions and personal responses, so we are mindful of including various mediums and types of art that warrant a spectrum of feelings,” says Jeff Toscano, CEO of Aspen Hospitality (which includes The Little Nell and Limelight Hotels). Toscano notes that the luxury group tracks guest feedback on every part of the hotel experience—especially art. “As a hospitality organization, guest satisfaction is our number one priority, so any and all art that we integrate into our hotels must positively enhance the energy of the spaces.”

Courtesy of Viceroy

While the art collection at Sugar Beach is extensive, the extent to which it influences the guest experience remains subjective. The degree to which travelers engage with these pieces will vary, and some may see it as an enhancement, while others may not consider it a defining element of their stay. Consumer willingness to support sustainable practices is evident, though it varies. A 2024 survey revealed that 6% of consumers worldwide would be willing to pay more than 50% extra to stay at sustainable hotels, while 44% indicated they would not pay more for such accommodations.

As the luxury travel sector continues to evolve, the intersection of contemporary art and hospitality is likely to become more pronounced. Whether or not this model is sustainable over the long term remains to be seen, particularly as trends in both art and travel are constantly shifting. After all, while hotel management didn’t provide a specific figure, Sugar Beach’s art collection was estimated to be in the “hundreds of millions of dollars” range. That kind of investment just isn’t achievable or realistic for many properties without an outside art collector with deep pockets involved.

However, the pointed inclusion of art within any given resort’s broader design will likely set it apart from properties where such features are confined to common areas.

“The integration of art into hotel design is a lasting shift,” Toscano says. “Luxury hotels are intended to be the best versions of home, and many of our guests have carefully curated their art collections at home.”"

Albert C. Barnes was born into poverty in 1872, in Philadelphia, and went on to make a fortune as the inventor of a topical antiseptic and to amass a staggering collection of modern art. Gopnik’s animated biography chronicles Barnes’s lifelong campaign to make art accessible to the working class, a democratizing impulse that found its greatest expression in the Barnes Foundation, which opened in 1925 to display his acquisitions. But the collector was also known for his irascibility, and Gopnik touches on the contradictions between his high-mindedness—Barnes was a stalwart defender of Black rights and culture—and his temper. Ultimately, Gopnik figures that “Barnes’s public cruelties might be just about balanced by private kindnesses.”

The Franklin Stove, by Joyce E. Chaplin (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). In the mid-eighteenth century, during a period of cooling known as the Little Ice Age, Benjamin Franklin began designing a heating device that would be more efficient than the traditional fireplace. Chaplin’s richly textured history documents the brilliant theories and innovations that led to the Franklin stove’s creation, but it also charts the human and environmental costs: produced in part by slave labor on tribal lands, the stove eventually burned coal. This story holds numerous lessons for our era; among them, Chaplin writes, is that any “techno-optimistic” solution to the climate crisis, though it might work in the short term, may have unintended, and potentially harmful, consequences.

Brent Amberger of Goobertown Hobbies fame and Casey, the creator of eBay Miniatures Rescue, showed up at this year’s AdeptiCon convention with a clever new way to paint your miniatures — and it could make one of the hobby’s most hated features a thing of the past.

The hated feature in question is the humble waterslide decal, which hobbyists across dozens of different franchises have come to loathe over the years. Done well, using something like Microscale Industries’ Micro Sol and Micro Set, decals can look great. But it can be incredibly challenging to get a decal to lay flat on a curved surface — you know, stuff like shields and the shoulder pauldrons on Space Marines. Even if you’ve mastered the process, which is ably described in the Winterdyne Commission Modeling Blog guide to Waterslide Decals (included as part of our larger miniatures painting guide), it can still go pear-shaped on you if your surface isn’t properly prepared. The result? A ghostly white outline surrounding the art on the decal itself.

Brent and Casey, partners in the newly formed Goblin Hobbies, recently discovered nail art stamping plates. These chemically etched metal plates can be made to feature any kind of two-dimensional art that you like. Drop a little paint on the plate, wipe it smooth, and you can pick the image up off the plate with a silicone pad. Just gently press the pad onto your miniature, and Bob’s your uncle. Their silicone pads are even transparent, so you can see your model through the handle to line things up perfectly.

The technology to do this kind of thing with ink and paint has been around for centuries. I’m sure my grandfather had something similar for his basement printing business in the 1940s. But its application to nail art is relatively new. Goblin Hobbies hopes to bring it even further, into the mainstream of hobby miniatures gaming. They even have dreams of licensed kits for your favorite factions from universes like BattleTech and Warhammer 40,000."

But perhaps one of the most joyful celebrations of that connection was tucked away among the hustle and bustle of the show floor.

At the back side of a special anime and manga pavilion on the Celebration show floor, primarily dedicated to displays of concept art and props from the first two volumes of Star Wars Visions, a whole wall of art invited congoers to see a special mashup gallery merging the worlds of Studio Ghibli and Star Wars.

Featuring art from a bevy of talent from across Lucasfilm divisions—spearheaded by, of course, none other than noted Ghibli fan Dave Filoni himself—the gallery saw characters and ideas from across Star Wars merge with iconic Ghibli films and imagery, from Porco Rosso to Princess Mononoke, and even touching on Lucasfilm’s actual official collaboration with the studio, Zen: Grogu and Dust Bunnies.

“Japan has always influenced my creativity. I grew up loving Tokusatsu, and was captivated by anime series like Macross,” Filoni wrote in a message accompanying his own art piece in the collection, “Ahsokanoke”, depicting Ahsoka and Grogu in a Ghibli-esque style.

“After I saw Miyazaki’s film Princess Mononoke, it changed the way I thought about animation. I loved everything about that film and it made a lasting impression on me. When I went to create Ahsoka Tano, I knew I wanted to imbue her with a bit of San. So this is why Ahsoka has two ‘wolf fangs’ on her cheeks, in homage to Miyazaki’s film.”

Since the release of the AirPods Pro 2 last September, you’ve made it through Black Friday, Cyber Week, Christmas, New Year’s, MLK Day, and Presidents Day sales events without caving. Now Easter’s just a few days away and, lo and behold, the AirPods Pro 2 are on sale again, this time for $60 off (24% off) at Amazon.

If this is finally the offer that gets you to make the upgrade — and at just $190 it’s an exceptionally good deal — you might end up wonder what in the heck took you so long to discover the huge difference the H2 chipset, vastly improved Active Noise Cancellation, clinical hearing protection, and overall amazing sound of the AirPods Pro 2. There’s only one way to find out, though, and that’s by heading to Amazon while the AirPods Pro 2 are still 24% off.

See at Amazon

Great Leap Forward

The AirPods Pro 2 might look like most of the previous iterations of Apple’s famous wireless earbuds, but once you put them in and cue up some tunes, you’ll figure out pretty quickly that these represent an enormous upgrade. Apple’s H2 chip powers a new, improved low-distortion driver that delivers outstanding clarity from both high notes and low bass notes.

The AirPods Pro 2 also feature Personalized Spatial Audio that intelligently detects the unique shape of your ear and also tracks the movements of your head as you listen, and creates the ideal sound for your unique features. Add in the new Voice Isolation technology that greatly enhances the quality of your phone calls even when you’re in a loud or crowded area, and the AirPods Pro 2 truly stand head and shoulders above their predecessors.

Only the Sound You Want

The greatest advantage the AirPods Pro 2 hold over previous models is probably the vastly improved Active Noise Cancellation, which removes up to 2 times more background noise than the original AirPods Pro, and even more than the brand-new AirPods 4. You can easily toggle from Noise Cancellation to Transparency Mode to still deliver pro-level sound without rendering you completely oblivious to your surroundings.

The battery life of the AirPods Pro 2 is an impressive 6 hours on a single charge and up to 30 hours when you add a fully juiced charging case. There are also more ways to recharge that case than ever before, with USB-C, MagSafe, Qi-certified, and even Apple Watch chargers now available options.

This Easter Week Amazon sale taking $60 off the price of the AirPods Pro 2 could very well be the one that finally gets you to take the plunge and upgrade to Apple’s dynamic new flagship wireless earbuds. Don’t wait for the next holiday event — head to Amazon now and grab the AirPods Pro 2 for just $190.

I can spot IKEA from … [+4122 chars]","The artist Ser Serpas was riding shotgun in a rented U-Haul truck through Williamsburg the other day, lamenting the state of New York junk. “Our stuff is just flimsier,” she said. “I can spot IKEA from a mile away.” Just then, her driver, the art handler Neo Gibson, clocked a steel object nestled in a heap of deli trash: a circular, city-issued bike rack, freshly ripped from the sidewalk. The pair put on work gloves, then slotted the rack into their truck between a rusted table frame, a purple vacuum, and the base of a futon. “Those exposed bolts!” Serpas said admiringly.

Serpas has transformed her haul into a series of junk-pile sculptures for “The Gatherers,” a group exhibition at MoMA PS1 opening later this month which focusses on contemporary waste. She will then fly to Switzerland to begin curbside scavenging for a show at Kunsthalle Basel. But new Swiss restrictions on bulk garbage disposal are creating panic among the curators. “They’re worried there won’t be enough trash for me to fill five rooms,” Serpas, who is twenty-nine and lives on the Lower East Side, said. She wore blue coveralls and old white Converses, her standard picking uniform.

As the U-Haul zigzagged beneath the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, Serpas ignored a hot-water heater (“too heavy”) and a mattress propped against a utility pole. “I’m not a mattress person anymore,” she said. An abandoned orange shopping cart was added to the pile, then quickly filled with silver snack-bag material pulled from a dumpster belonging to NAP Industries, “a leader in flexible packaging manufacturing since 1963,” according to a sign. Serpas beamed: “It’s so light and radiant. I can make a disco ball with this.”

In sanitation circles, amateur trash pickers are known as “garbage groupies.” The art world prefers “assemblagists.” Either way, Serpas is a rising star of the movement, earning accolades for recent biennials at the Whitney and the Hammer, in L.A. She favors worn-out home furnishings and industrial components for her combines, which she stacks precariously on-site and sometimes sets ablaze. “Tbilisi has the best trash because everything is passed down for so long,” she said. “Paris is also good. In New York, you need to know where to look.” The previous day’s trip to Red Hook had yielded the remains of an elevator shaft, a car windshield, a stack of mops, and a frayed trampoline. “We have a lot of flat things,” Serpas said. “Now I need orifices.”

On Wythe Avenue, the truck lurched to a stop behind a pair of professional junk luggers, who were hauling away the contents of a gutted luxury apartment. “They’re taking all our shit!” Serpas said, striding toward the competition. One of the luggers offered her the pick of the litter but warned against some old chairs.

“Those are rotting,” he said.

“Like, bug-rotting?” Serpas asked. She plucked an umbrella stand and some lawn chairs from the pile instead.

Serpas got into assemblage eight years ago, after earning a fine-arts degree from Columbia. Struggling to produce mixed-media sculptures for a solo show at a gallery in Miami, she stumbled across the remains of a foreclosed house in South Beach. “It was a eureka moment,” she recalled. She stayed up all night assembling the detritus into gridded displays: an overturned armchair doused in gasoline, a glass tabletop balanced on a bookshelf wrapped in electrical wiring. The show was a success—the Rubell Museum acquired pieces—and also a lesson. “The bookcase had termites,” Serpas said. “They needed to get the gallery fumigated.” Otherwise, she said, “I’ve never caused an active infestation in any of the ten or fifteen galleries I’ve shown in. Knock on wood.”

Some institutions have their own sanitary precautions. Before her show at PS1, a vender from Ozone Park will treat the found objects with a substance known as Vikane. The Whitney has a fumigation guy who uses a process called ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. Last year, the museum rejected two pieces of metal sheathing that Serpas had intended to use in its biennial alongside a note: “Bird poop Serpas.”

Back at her studio, in Williamsburg, Serpas assessed the day’s collection. “They all have a good palette,” she said. “I can start to see it coming together.” She paused to rest in the studio’s “lounge”: a few tattered chairs and a coffee table—leftovers from past sculptures, already fumigated. ♦"

Carrying on a legacy that began with the 3DCG Clone Wars series, before carrying on into the likes of Rebels, Resistance, Bad Batch, and animated anthologies like the Tales series, Maul: Shadow Lord will follow Maul (played by returning Clone Wars and Rebels star Sam Witwer), seemingly as he builds out the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate. The trailer shown to gathered fans in the hall included various Criminal factions like the Pykes reeling from attacks on shipments, only for Maul to reveal himself as the architect. While the show’s look is a broad evolution of the art style seen in Clone Wars and later the Tales anthologies, there is also a new stylistic flourish in Shadow Lord‘s aesthetic that leans on rough lines and ragged edges, best glimpsed in Maul’s crimson saber blades, which look almost fiery in appearance.

One of the most interesting elements of the whole trailer was that Maul finds himself what appears to be a young new apprentice in the ways of the Force: a young Twi’lek girl he liberates from captivity and then begins teaching. Alongside her tutelage, we see shots of gang wars, intense chases through the hustle and bustle of a city planet (not unlike Coruscant, but would Maul really be playing in his old master’s back yard like that? We’ll have to wait and see), and even an encounter with the Inquisitorius in the form of Ahsoka‘s Marrok, who expresses his surprise that Maul has survived even as he draws sabers with him.

Maul: Shadow Lord will release in 2026.

What it doesn't usually involve? Painting over a strawberry mural, peeling googly eyes off the door frame, and removing a fairy woodland outlet cover.

But for NYC-based designer and creator Chelsea Zeferina, that was exactly her to-do list—and she documented the whole thing for her millions of followers.

If you’ve ever wanted to live inside a mood board, her past apartment was just that. Think cherry wall hooks, disco garland, and banana draw pulls.

Shop the Story

Some finds were sourced from Etsy (like a vintage cat light switch cover), others from Facebook Marketplace, and many dreamed up in her own imagination. She painted stripes on the wall and turned a plain side table into a citrus-inspired masterpiece.

Even as a renter, she never shied away from bold decor choices—until a non-renewal notice forced her to move out.

The internet mourned alongside her, racking up millions of views on her moving-out videos. But her new apartment? Just as colorful, if not more so.

Her style falls into what’s been dubbed “dopamine decor”—a maximalist, color-happy approach to interiors where the only rule is choosing what makes you smile. It’s nostalgic, playful, and rooted in self-expression, and with millions of TikTok views on the topic, it's clear that people are craving more of it.

So how does she do it? And how can you bring the look home? Chelsea shares her best tips below.

What is dopamine decor?

At its core, dopamine decor is all about joy. “It’s an easy way to add a spark of happiness into your life from the moment you open your eyes in the morning,” Chelsea explains. It leans into bold colors, funky patterns, nostalgic objects, and whimsical details—think squiggle mirrors, retro florals, and statement lighting. The best part? There are no rules. If it makes you happy, it belongs.

It’s an easy way to add a spark of happiness into your life from the moment you open your eyes in the morning

Why is it trending?

With thousands of videos and millions of views, dopamine decor is having a moment. And for good reason. “In a world full of chaos, I think people are looking for any way to add more happiness to their everyday life,” Chelsea says. Gone are the days of all-neutral, ultra-minimalist homes—maximalism is back, and this time, it's all about self-expression.

In a world full of chaos, I think people are looking for any way to add more happiness to their everyday life

How can someone achieve this look?

If you’re starting from scratch, Chelsea recommends easing in with small, low-commitment pieces. “Colorful throw pillows, quirky candles, and fun vases are easy ways to test out the aesthetic,” she says. From there, you can build up to bigger statement pieces, like a bold rug or patterned wallpaper.

How do you mix so many colors and patterns without it feeling chaotic?

“I don’t worry too much about the overall picture,” Chelsea says. “I think sometimes people put too much pressure on themselves to figure out the aesthetic of a space before they start decorating.” Instead, she starts with one statement piece—like a rug, a curtain, or even a framed print—and lets that guide the rest of the room.

Where do you find your most unique pieces?

Chelsea’s best sources? Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, and local craft fairs. “I love finding basic, affordable pieces and DIYing them to make them my own,” she says. Case in point: the IKEA stools she hand-painted with flowers and lemons. “Some of my favorite pieces are the ones that I’ve personalized,” she added.

“In my experience, most projects are a lot easier to reverse than people think they are,” Chelsea reassures. “Painting a door frame back to white can be done in a couple of hours!” Other easy, renter-friendly upgrades include swapping cabinet pulls, using peel-and-stick wallpaper, and hanging colorful frames.

Got a space that tells a story? We’re always on the lookout for cozy corners, bold paint jobs, vintage gems, and homes that feel lived-in and loved. If you think your apartment or home deserves a moment in the spotlight, send me a note!"

NEW ORLEANS – A hero's welcome greets 18 women at the National World War Two Museum. Staff and museum visitors line a plaza, waving American flags and cheering as the women arrive, adorned in the red and white polka dot scarfs that are a signature of Rosie the Riveters.

They're here to be honored as Congressional Gold Medal recipients. But first, each Rosie gets a personal tour of the museum, starting in the home front exhibit.

""Look at the women welders, now that's a familiar job,"" says Jane Tucker, now 97. She left rural Lineville, Alabama in 1943, with her mom and sister to work in a shipyard.

""I worked in Savannah, Georgia building Liberty ships, and I learned to become a welder when I was just 16,"" Tucker says. ""It was all top secret. Loose lips will sink ships.""

She says they worked ten-hour days, at least six days a week.

Tucker was one of an estimated 5 million civilian women who worked in the defense industry and elsewhere while men were fighting overseas.

Tucker says they were trailblazers, proving that women can succeed in what was considered ""men's jobs"" at the time.

""The men said we couldn't do it,"" she recalls. ""They said, 'Oh, they're too emotional, they're too petty. They'll be sick a lot. They won't come to work and they'll be too weak to do the heavy work.' So we said 'we can do it!'""

""We Can Do It"" is the slogan on the iconic poster of a female factory worker, muscle flexed, and head wrapped in a red and white bandana.

Norman Rockwell's famous painting of a Rosie was on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post in 1943.

The symbol has endured.



""Rosie has come to stand for an image of empowerment,"" says Kimberly Guise, senior curator at the National World War Two Museum. ""A symbol of strength and can-do spirit.""

Guise says after the war, women were generally forced out of the workforce when service members returned home. But what they did changed the labor landscape.

""One of the major achievements was it showed the American public that women could perform this type of work,"" says Guise. ""It also showed the women themselves that they could do hard things.""

""I feel proud at what I did,"" says Mary Masciangelo, who just turned 100. ""Proud.""

She worked at an optical factory in Rochester, New York in 1943.

""I made pins for the parachutes,"" she says. ""And I put temples on the Air Corps' glasses.""

She was 16 years old at the time.

Erlinda Avila of Phoenix was just 15 when she worked as a riveter on B-25 bombers. It was hard work.

""From inside the wings, that's where I used to work,"" Avila says. ""I was little enough I could crawl in the wings.""

Avila says she was motivated to serve when her brother was drafted and sent to Japan, so she went to the Army recruiter.

""I've come to enlist,"" she told him. ""I want to join the army.""

She was turned away because of her gender. Avila was undeterred.

""I said, 'there must be something I can do.' That's when I heard that they needed girls, women to work in the defense plant.""

Avila says it was freeing, noting that members of her Navajo tribe could not even vote at the time. Now, as she approaches her 101st birthday next month Avila offers words of wisdom to young women today.

""Don't ever give up. You can do it. Believe in yourselves.""

The Gary Sinise Foundation's Soaring Valor Program brought this group of Rosies to New Orleans.

""It's truly our honor to just thank them and let them know that we don't forget their service or their sacrifices for our country,"" says Foundation Vice President Cristin Kampsnider.

""Oftentimes it's the soldiers who are really paid attention to, as they should, and these women are often forgotten,"" she says. ""We're here to remind them that we do not forget them and that they really are truly critical and wonderful. And what they did was very, very appreciated.""

The foundation is working with the World War Two museum to collect oral histories of the Rosies for the archives here, including African-American women.

""Weren't that many Black girls who did this anyhow,"" says Susan Taylor King. She was a riveter during WWII in Baltimore, Maryland.

She built small parts for planes, and says even though Baltimore was a segregated city at the time, that changed in the aircraft factory.



""I think it was the first time in my life that we could go in a dining hall, eat with everybody because they could not segregate against us when we worked on the federal jobs,"" she recalls.

King, now 100 years old, says it took years for her to realize the role she played in American history.

""We did this because we wanted to win the war,"" says King. ""I think as I grew older and history of America begins to be told it's important.""

""She is a living legacy,"" says King's daughter Kididi Ajanku, pleased to see her mother getting her ""just due"" while she's still living.

""I think people break boundaries and make history every day just to survive. At least African Americans. Survival is doing that,"" says Ajanku. ""So for my mother to be honored, it's just due. It's a long time in coming and I am forever proud.""

Indeed, the Rosies were treated like war heroes, getting accolades from museum patrons who realized who they were. The women happily posed for pictures, muscles flexed in true Rosie form.

Jane Tucker says it's an awesome experience.

""We never did think we'd be stars when we were building ships,"" she says. ""But look at this! And thanks to people who care about women and their freedom."""

The outpost is owned by the art dealer, Leslie Roberts, who has been charged in federal court for “conspiring to sell forged art,” as per Artnet. “The 62-year-old dealer used fraudulent invoices and authentication documents to sell the works, officials claim.”

Accompanying Roberts in charges is a 37-year old man named Carlos Miguel Rodriguez Melendez who was hit with charges for wire fraud that linked to the forged artwork . Both individuals were arrested, but as of now, are free on bail with a slated April 21 arraignment. If they’re found guilty, the pair face up to 20 years in federal prison.

The indictment stated that Roberts relayed the pieces as original paintings connected to the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts. Melendez seemingly claimed that he worked at an auction house in New York to convince the victims into thinking that the works were authentic.

“To make the fraudulent art appear to be authentic pieces created by Andy Warhol, Leslie Howard Roberts utilized forged authentication documents that were purportedly provided by the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board, Inc.,” as per the indictment.

The New York Times reported that one of the victims was a family of art collectors, Matthew, Judy and Richard Perlman with the family having filed a civil lawsuit against Roberts claiming that he enticed them to pay over $6 million USD for the bootleg Warhols. “The Perelman family acquired more than 250 works, and paid $325,000 USD for a collection of depictions of Mao Zedong, one of Warhol’s most popular subjects."

Bringing together an exciting lineup of 30 emerging and established artists, Halsey refuses white-cube sterility, and nurtures, as she puts it, “the spirit of a kiccbacc” – an opportunity for pleasure, rekindling old connections and cultivating new ones.

Spanning installation, painting, photography, mixed-media and sculptures, resonance thrives in its multiplicity. Each work takes root in Halsey’s ethos of community-driven creativity, and threaded together by the figuration of people, plants and animals as metaphors for interconnectedness, care and lived experience.

Best known for her large-scale foil collages, Halsey’s immersive installations braid real and imagined geographies to bring forth a mythology of her own. Fusing the raw visuals of South Central with ancient Egyptian iconography, her work culminates in speculative spaces, remixing personal history, ancestral knowledge and lost legacies.

The exhibition will be on view in Chicago from April 23 through May 24. Check out the full list of featured artists below:

She also loves screen printing, monoprinting and RISO techniques to enhances her storytelling.

Before we go on, and if you're inspired by Valerya, then read our list of Procreate tutorials to get started in this app, and our guide to the best iPads for drawing. Read our xTool Screen Printer review too, for a device to get started in this craft.

Back to Valerya, and she uses her sketchbooks in an ""unconventional"" way. They're more of a tool to achieve unique and unexpected textures and brushstrokes that are then transferred to the Procreate app. All her illustrations begin on paper, where she feels more free to experiment and assists happy accidents.

""I graduated from the University of Hertfordshire's Illustration course in 2023 and applied to several picturebook illustration agencies seeking representation. Advocate Art has responded quite promptly and I have been working with them for almost two years since,"" shares Valerya. Take a look at Valerya's work on her website.

She adds: ""I have also participated in several illustration competitions during my studies, such as the Batsford Prize, and later that year the Unpublished Picturebook showcase. Being shortlisted for those awards helped me kickstart my career and opened a path for new opportunities.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

I ask Valerya about her distinctive process of starting illustrations in her sketchbook and then finishing them in Procreate.

""I usually start with a physical drawing on paper with watercolour, gouache, charcoal pencils, and sometimes ink,"" she says.

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

She adds: ""The digital process for me consists of colour editing (through curves and colour balance in Procreate) and then I draw over the painting with digital brushes. And if I start with a black and white ink painting, I first colour it to achieve the desired look with Multiply and Overlay layers.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

Valerya specifies: ""My favourite brush is definitely the Freycinet Brush from the drawing category – I use it basically for everything, the literary and the colour, it has great texture and mixes perfectly with the watercolour texture. I almost just recently started making my own brushes from my watercolour scans, which helps achieve a cohesive look.""

I ask her to point out the main aspects she focuses on in the traditional stage, ""Texture, composition, values, and colours are the most important ones for me,"" she says.

She continues: ""The latter could of course be edited digitally, but I still like to think about how colours interact with each other and how they blend creating smooth gradients. And I try to not make the traditional paintings too polished – so there is some looseness and life left in them. I don't want to overwork them, there is beauty in imperfection!""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

Since texture is very important for Valerya, I ask her what combination of tools and media allows her to achieve it, and she replies, ""Watercolour, ink, charcoal, coloured pencils, and gouache (still testing it out)"".

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

She continues: ""I like mixing blues and greens and combining translucent textures (like ink and watercolour) with more thick ones (like gouache). Also charcoal helps adding the final touches, smudges, shading.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

I ask Valerya how did you develop a sketchbook routine and how do you manage to stay consistent?

""I do carry a small sketchbook with me everywhere, but I still don't use it every time. It's nice to have it and draw on the way home after meeting with friends, or while waiting for a coffee and a bun, or at the busy London pub where people won't notice you are spying on them,"" she says.

She then adds: ""I think I can work on being more consistent with my sketchbook practice, as sometimes I just don't have the energy to create after working on books.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

I ask her about her sources of inspiration, ""It could be something I saw on my walk, a picture I took, a film, or a book,"" Valerya says.

But what if you can't come up with anything? ""The ideas come to me when I'm most relaxed, so I try to not force myself into creating but rather allow myself to rest, and observe the world around me freely,"" reflects Valerya.

She adds: ""Sometimes I search for references online – I often find a picture that inspire me on Pinterest, and then I think of my own way of interpreting the same narrative, colour palette, composition, or whatever caught my eye.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

I ask Valerya to point out her favorite pages, ''Definitely the most spontaneous ones, where I drew quickly, trying to grasp the form and the character of a person,"" she says.

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

""Here I was not actively thinking about the strokes or the materials, but rather about capturing the unexpected gesture, emotion, and posture. I sketched these people on my way home in the underground, and coloured them later,"" she describes.

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

Valerya says, ""I think I managed to capture the essence of the flowers without overworking them, love the looseness and textures!"" (You can find more of them on Valerya's Instagram page.)

Artists usually have more than one sketchbook so I want to know how many sketchbooks Valerya uses at a time. And which are the goals for each of them?

""I currently have two main sketchbooks,"" Valerya says, then adds: ""One is a tiny A6 book with thinner paper that I take everywhere. It is mainly for the people watching in the underground, at the cafe, or during art fairs. It also sometimes works for testing the materials.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

She continues: ""The other sketchbook is not a sketchbook at all, or at least when I'm finished with it. It starts with an A4 mixed media pad, where I draw the textures, backgrounds, and separate characters for the books.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

She says: ""Here I did a lot of character sketches for the Your Marvellous Masterpiece picture book. I've also created many ink textures that were later scanned and applied to the final illustrations in Procreate. As I need to scan the pages one by one I tear the pad apart, and thus I have a collection of A4 pages just lying around.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

But it hasn't been always like that. ""Back when I was a child and just started learning how to draw independently from the art school, I had a huge collection of sketchbooks and I used to finish them in a month or two. I was so motivated to learn all the techniques, play with the materials, and explore what styles I could do that I made a rule for myself – no starting a new sketchbook until the current one was finished, that way I was committed and motivated, and got a sense of accomplishment after each one,"" Valerya adds.

There are many sketchbook challenges going on on social media at the moment, so I'm curious to know if she took part in any of these.

""I have participated in a few of them over the years. But I think I have only finished one - the Inktober. I guess working with ink and B&W materials has its own limitations, and having those limitations helps overcome the fear of imperfection. With fewer choices to agonise over – no colours to blend, no complex mediums to experiment with, I'm forced to focus on the essentials: composition, contrast, and line work. Instead of getting stuck on making everything ""perfect,"" I just keep moving forward, embracing the spontaneity of ink.""

She continues: ""The Mermay or Peachtober challenges just didn't stick – too much pressure and freedom for everyday drawings, especially if you have illustration work besides the challenge.

""I did actually create a few of my own sketchbook challenges – like drawing women in different outfits for 30 days or painting simple ink images and printing them on Riso right away. These helped me stay consistent, and the themes were something I was truly interested in.""

(Image credit: Valerya Milovanova)

I ask Valerya what skills she has improved the most by practicing consistently in her sketchbook?

""Line confidence and the ability to observe and capture shapes quickly are the biggest skills I've improved the most. The more I sketch, the less hesitant my strokes are. I’ve learned to trust my hand and commit to marks without overthinking. And I've learned to trust the materials and allow the 'happy mistakes' to happen, as they make the final piece more genuine, more unexpected, and surprising even for me.""

For Women's History Month, I wanted to highlight Victoria Woodhull, who wrote a letter to the New York Herald in 1870 announcing that she was running for president. At the time, women were not allowed to vote, but there were no laws against launching a presidential campaign — perhaps because no one could have imagined that a woman ever would.

Woodhull was a passionate suffragist who has mostly been forgotten by history. The suffragists of her time kept their distance because she had other ""scandalous"" views they didn't want to tarnish their cause. She was also a divorced woman with a controversial past, as a Spiritualist clairvoyant and the daughter of a conman who had roped his family into numerous criminal schemes.

However, as someone who went from uneducated bumpkin to one of the richest and most controversial people of her era, and someone who was not afraid to take action against injustices, and who went from riches back to rags in order to promote her ideas for a better nation, she ought to stand amongst the most iconic Americans in history.

Field Notes has long built its brand around craftsmanship and nostalgia. With its latest Quarterly Edition, “The Chicago Look,” the Chicago-based company leans into graphic design history, channeling the energy and optimism of post-WWII signage into a new 6×8” format. For designers and creatives, it’s a tactile tribute to a golden era of visual communication.

A nod to the Beverly Sign Co.

The edition is inspired by the Beverly Sign Co., a now-defunct outfit that made its mark in the 1950s and ’60s. Known for panelized layouts, bold letterforms, and high-contrast palettes, Beverly Sign Co. helped shape what came to be called the “Chicago Look.” It was a style that didn’t just stay local — it influenced commercial sign painters across the U.S.

Field Notes’ team discovered this design legacy through The Golden Era of Sign Design by Kelsey Dalton McClellan and Andrew McClellan. The book archives original sketches, notes, and swatches that guided painters — also known as “wall dogs” — as they hand-lettered storefronts and billboards. These hand-drawn artifacts, rich with penciled-in feedback and vibrant color studies, served as the launchpad for this edition’s visual identity.

Designed to feel like a working document

To capture the spirit of those original proofs, Field Notes brought in the McClellans and fellow sign painter Bob Behounek to design two covers that echo the look and feel of an in-progress sign. The covers are printed on Westrock Tango C1S 16pt stock, featuring diagonal color swatches and textured notes — a direct reference to the original documentation used by sign painters.

Each notebook includes 64 pages of Domtar Lynx Opaque paper, with a light-blue grid printed in soy-based ink. The decision to scale up from the standard size to a larger 6×8” format gives designers more room to sketch, ideate, and build — a functional choice that also elevates the presence of the historic reference.

A graphic design collectible

At $14.95 for a 2-pack, “The Chicago Look” is more than a stationery release — it’s a mini design archive. Subscribers to Field Notes’ Quarterly Edition also receive a 2.25” “Wall Dogs Forever” pin and a postcard of one of the covers as a full-sized, hand-painted sign now installed at Field Notes HQ.

In a time when much of graphic design lives on screens, this collection reconnects creatives with physical process and historical context. It celebrates the analog precision of mid-century sign painters — those who shaped cityscapes with brushes, not pixels.

For designers looking to get inspired by the roots of visual branding, this edition delivers a rare mix of design history, material beauty, and functionality.

Archaeologists have discovered a mysterious new king of ancient Egypt, buried in a network of tombs at Anubis Mountain.

""Discovering king's tombs, new pharaohs, are few and far between,"" Josef Wegner, a leader of the team that uncovered the new tomb, told Business Insider.

Researchers don't know this pharaoh's identity because they think ancient grave robbers damaged the marking of his name on the tomb wall. Still, he could help illuminate a forgotten era of Egyptian history from about 1640 BCE to 1540 BCE, when warrior pharaohs battled each other for territory.

""It's a really fascinating period of turmoil, conflict,"" said Wegner, who teaches Egyptian archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania and curates the Penn Museum's Egyptian section.

""It gives birth to the new kingdom, the famous golden age of many of the well-known pharaohs like King Tut and the Ramses kings,"" he added.

Tattoos often have deeper meaning and a story to tell, especially to those who get them and to the artist that is designing and creating them. You’ll get to experience a taste of that feeling when you play this game as it sees you working at a tattoo parlor and capturing those meanings with your work. You’re not just stuck in the shop all the time, though, as you can switch between working in your tattoo parlor and exploring the town, seeing what exactly is going on in this area and how it’s changing.

The story around your town, Nortown, is that the entire place is going to be demolitioned to make way for a new commercial hub. Everyone is battling with this massive change and what’s going to happen to their lives. You are able to explore this town, talking to the individuals you come across about what is going on. The atmosphere at your parlor also reflects the changes that happen to the staff there who are more than aware of what’s going on.

Thankfully, Inkression is a story-based game where you do not need to actually be good at drawing and creating the tattoos. Instead, the game will wipe away any ink that’s outside of the lines and will often allow you to skip coloring in the designs if the story has been presented to you.

I got the chance to play through some of Inkression at Day of the Devs, where I was interested in this town and its story. Things there look a little old and faded, but taking the time to transform these stories into art so that they will be remembered feels so important. The captivating story and ease of playing really caught my attention, making me excited to see the full game once it’s out.

Inkression is currently in development, but in the meantime, you can grab a demo or add the game to your wishlist on Steam.

These cultures are showcased in varied artesanías (handcrafts) or artes populares (popular arts). In Oaxaca, like in other states, each town specializes in a specific craft, and in the case of San Bartolo Coyotepec, its craft is pottery made from a distinctive local black clay (barro negro).

Tzompantlis, skull racks from Mexico’s pre-Columbian period, were common across several peoples, including the Maya and the Zapotec. Perhaps the best example is the one in Tenochtitlán (now Mexico City). With their striking display of neatly organized human skulls, tzompantli have inspired many modern artistic interpretations, including “El Mural de la Conquista” (“The Mural of the Conquest”).

Artist Carlomagno Pedro Martínez created this work, which was first displayed in Paris at the La Villet Cultural Center in 2002. The mural features a central tzompantli panel and makes symbolic use of other skulls, including a much smaller tzompantli, on the floor section. In front, subtitled “Apology of the Conquest,” five old women represent five centuries since the Spanish conquest, as well as a funeral. The back shows a map of Mexico and two armed figures—one resembling a revolutionary from the early 1900s, possibly Emiliano Zapata, and another wearing a balaclava typical of the EZLN (Zapatista Army of National Liberation). Carlomagno’s Zapotec ancestry connects both revolutionary movements to contemporary Indigenous resistance.

The lower panel features skeletons with insect features above a skeleton representing Martín Cortés, son of conquistador Hernán Cortés and his Indigenous interpreter Malintzin (also known as Malinche), often considered one of the first mestizo Mexicans. This mix of peoples and cultures appears elsewhere on the mural, like the upper panel where skeletons appear atop a Christian church and a pre-Columbian pyramid. The side panels depict violent cultural clashes that ultimately forged a new Mexican culture.

Martínez is also the director of the State of Oaxaca Museum of Popular Art (MEAPO), which he helped establish through fundraising beginning in 1994. After opening in 1996, the museum reopened in its current location in 2004, showcasing not only San Bartolo Coyotepec’s distinctive barro negro, but also works from across Oaxaca. The museum’s upper floor houses a mask collection, many from coastal regions and featuring real animal elements like hair and horns. The museum also has an active calendar of temporary exhibits, showcasing up-and-coming artisans as well as established masters of their craft."

The painting had never been properly photographed, so Csoke borrowed it from its owner and met me at a coffee shop, carrying the portrait in a tote bag so that I could scan it. Csoke’s pink-trimmed, hand-painted apartment was recently featured in New York magazine.

To illustrate Howard French’s essay about the books and ideas of Alvin Toffler, the futurist and author of Future Shock, I asked Michelle Mildenberg. She drew a “young Toffler seen from the back looking at a spiral of technological imagery from China.” Before she delivered the final proof, I asked her to change the color of his shirt from brown to green. And for Cathleen Schine’s review of Hanif Kureshi’s recent memoir about an accident that left him tetraplegic, I asked Carly Blumenthal for a portrait. Her fine-grained pencil-crayon rendering feels as intimate as Schine’s descriptions of Kureshi’s patient, careful writing.

For her third portrait for us, the London-based illustrator Ruby Ash drew the Argentine writer Hebe Uhart seated on a bus, a scene from Natasha Wimmer’s essay about Uhart’s travel writing. When I sent a draft of Jonathan Mingle’s essay about phosphorous and soil nutrients to Jason Logan, he looked up the element and then texted me: “I read that there is phosphorus in the striker of matches and in the tip of some safety matches, and I had some ingredients left over from my tests with gunpowder.” We used his abstract Sulphur Test to accompany Mingle’s article.

I asked the Toronto-based illustrator Natàlia Pàmies Lluís for a portrait of the Chilean writer Benjamín Labatut for Dan Rockmore’s review of his books The MANIAC and When We Cease to Understand the World. It was her first portrait for us, and she explained that she “wanted to visually explore destruction and madness, incorporating elements like an explosion emerging from his hair.”

The series art in the issue, Bajo el Alma, is by Fernanda Amis, whose drawings of figures, scenes, and comics feels like a cross between Mark Alan Stamaty and Polly Nor.

The Spring Books issue means it’s time for one of our four annual hand-lettered and hand-drawn covers. I’d been wanting to work with Maria-Ines Gul since 2020, when Kaye Blegvad sent me a zine of Gul’s erotic drawings (a few of which I used to illustrate Elaine Blair’s 2023 essay about porn). When I asked Gul to illustrate our Spring Books cover, she sent a number of gorgeous sketches evoking the mood of the season, including abstract weather patterns, the sunlit facade of a building, and a cup of clouds, which is what we decided on. Gul titled her cover Clouds in My Coffee.

Andrea Ventura painted the historian Catherine Hall for Fara Dabhoiwala’s essay about her life and work, but when Ventura turned in the final image, we decided that we actually preferred his initial sketch. He took no offence, writing, “I understand. I love that about drawings, when you are less aware it’s better.” In the case of Romy Blümel’s lush portrait of Katie Kitamura, for Laura Marsh’s review of Kitamura’s new novel, Audition, we made a few edits before landing on the final.

The London-based illustrator Paul Davis wrote to say that it “made his day” to be assigned Fintan O’Toole’s essay about the president and the EU, and after a little back and forth, he delivered a grumpy Trump straddling Europe and tearing the EU flag. For Francisco Cantú’s review of The Afterlife Is Letting Go, Brandon Shimoda’s book about Japanese internment and the US’s history of migrant detention, I looked for a painting by the Japanese artist Hiroki Kawanabe that could allude to the themes of disconnection and the erosion of history. His painting Wide Street (2024) seemed to convey the appropriate sense of isolation.

Georgie McAusland drew the novelist and poet Joe Dunthorne for Francine Prose’s review of his latest book, which details the story of his great-grandfather, a Jewish scientist who, in the 1930s, developed chemical weapons for the Nazis. McAusland included the writer’s Geiger counter in her portrait, alongside cloudy likenesses of his ancestors, which, as one editor pointed out, echoed the cover in an uncanny way. Yann Kebbi and his mighty pencil gave us a vigorous drawing of Larry McMurtry to illustrate Thomas Powers’s essay about the writer’s life and, in particular, Lonesome Dove.

I asked the photographer Jason Fulford if he had any images that might be appropriate for David Cole’s article about academic freedom. To my delight he had a series of pictures from Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, including some shots of the two-sided “Erase/Do Not Erase” signs that professors use for classroom blackboards. A simple “Do Not Erase” conveyed Cole’s point in a wonderful way.

In his review of a new book by the philosopher Thomas Nagel, Peter Singer writes about moral progress and decision making. The artist Greg Burak recently had a show, Psychologistics, at New York’s March Gallery, and I thought some of his de Chirico–esque work could be a good fit. Instead, we went with a painting of his from 2022, The Candidate, depicting two figures holding candles, one of them blindfolded. Burak’s 2020 painting Two Curses was on the cover of our November 18, 2021, issue.

Liana Finck sent me the series art for the issue—which she titled Scribbles—as she was headed into labor. Her messages calmly began “Hi from a hospital room,” with the art in an attachment, followed by a picture of her new baby. How I love the artists I work with.

In Jamaica my daughter kept asking me to Shazam the songs being played by the pool. After about ten songs I realized that most of the music on the playlist (Cat Stevens, Toots and the Maytals, Fairport Convention, Roxy Music, Marianne Faithfull, Bob Marley and the Wailers) had been produced by Chris Blackwell, the owner and developer of the resort, whose mother, Blanche, had been Ian Fleming’s longtime lover. But one song we looked up, and one that I keep returning to, was “Here Comes Trouble,” by Chronixx, which I sung under my breath as we approached border patrol in the United States."

With season 2 of Severance complete (with a remarkable bang), Apple TV+ has slid right into a new prestige series, The Studio, starring (and co-created by) Seth Rogen as the newly-appointed chief of the fictional and dysfunctional Continental Studios in Hollywood.

Two episodes in (out of 10 for the debut season), and it is fucking amazing. So far it feels a bit like a cross between Entourage, The Larry Sanders Show, Boogie Nights, and maybe a touch of Curb Your Enthusiasm. But the biggest influence and inspiration is clearly Robert Altman’s 1992 masterpiece The Player, almost certainly the best Hollywood movie about Hollywood moviemaking that ever was or will be made.

What The Studio and The Player share is that they’re about the struggle to create great cinematic art within a corporate studio world run by unartistic know-it-all self-important status-obsessed dullards driven by formula and fads — and, simultaneously, they are themselves almost unfathomably complicated and intricate works of cinematic art. They are what they’re about. They achieve what the characters within them fear is no longer achievable. When you get to episode 2 of The Studio, just keep asking yourself “Wait, how are they getting this shot?” The lighting, my god. The whole thing is just an outpouring of homage to the opening shot of The Player, which of course itself calls back, explicitly, to Orson Welles’s Touch of Evil.

The Studio is, thus far, engaging, surprising, funny, gorgeous, clever, and cinematically ambitious. It’s really quite a thing. I have no idea what’s coming in episodes 3–10, so maybe this piece will look a bit premature, if not foolish, in two months. But if the rest of season one is anything like the first two episodes, The Studio is a classic in the making.

The thought also occurs to me that this might be the don’t-over-think-it answer to just what the hell Apple is doing making original shows and movies in the first place. Perhaps Apple’s leadership simply believes, as I do, that cinema is the grandest and greatest form of art the world has ever seen — one that encompasses acting, writing, photography and/or illustration, and music — and but that great cinema is expensive and delicate and needs, from deep-pocketed studios and their deeper-pocketed corporate parents, more than patrons, but champions. And that in a media landscape where such champions of cinema-as-art and art-as-an-essential-public-good are fewer and fewer, it is Apple’s not just opportunity but obligation to step up to the plate.

I’ve long thought that one of the minor tragedies of Steve Jobs’s second act is that the timing just didn’t work out to sell Pixar to Apple, instead of to Disney. But make no mistake, a love and appreciation for great cinema is not outside Apple’s DNA. No streamer has a higher hit rate for quality shows. Their movies mostly stink so far, but maybe that’s just the learning curve. The Gorge, for example, feels like an Apple TV movie because it’s so decidedly meh. Not horrible, but not good in any way beyond its intriguing elevator-pitch concept. Wolfs was better but still a grand disappointment given its pedigree. But when it comes to shows, no one is doing better. Severance deserves all its acclaim and attention, and Ben Stiller delivered a season 2 finale that’s arguably the best 78 minutes of filmmaking I’ve seen this decade. And The Studio, to me, feels like an Apple TV show — not because of how it looks, what it’s about, or who’s in it, but simply because it’s so good. Netflix almost never makes shows like this. Neither does HBO now that’s its been subsumed by “Max”. Peacock et al don’t even try.1"

It dates from around 1535 and bears the title “Landscape with an Episode from the Conquest of America.” In the right of the picture, a platoon of soldiers, heavily armed and preceded by a pair of gun carriages, tramp through a defile. Evidently, it is not long since they came ashore; behind them, we can spy a strip of beach. Preparing to meet them is an angry band of what Mostaert, who certainly never crossed the Atlantic, imagined the people of the New World to be like. Mostly men, some of them elderly, all of them white, and all as naked as babies, they brandish longbows at their aggressors. Around them, the country seems no less fantastical—jagged outcrops of pale rock, rising from low brown hillocks. A bearded old man, in a cage made of wooden bars, surveys the scene from on high. In the foreground, away from the commotion, a rust-red cow grazes peacefully, while a hare is shown in mid-leap. Perched atop a broken tree is a monkey, which turns toward us as if to ask, “Who are the animals here?”

Peel yourself away from Mostaert’s painting, cross to a different wing of the museum, and you will find another bunch of Americans defending their way of life. To be precise, four young Latinas in a car—all of them brightly bejewelled, three of them tattooed. Their makeup is a work of art in itself. The picture is called “Homegirls, San Francisco,” and it dates from 2008. It was taken by the photographer Amanda López, who was born to Mexican parents in Sacramento, and who became fascinated by lowrider culture. (“I grew up with my cousin and his dad, they were always fixing Impalas,” López said in an interview in 2023.) The image, which is one of a set of lowrider photographs acquired by the Smithsonian, is dominated by the driver of the car, who rests her elbow on the edge of the open window and stares straight at us with a confidence that is at once challenging and completely relaxed.

“Homegirls, San Francisco” is part of a major exhibition, “American Photography,” which runs at the Rijksmuseum until June 9th. The show is, in the best sense, all over the place. Rather than adhering to a firmly chronological format, it darts to and fro through the decades. The rooms are organized by theme. A section of portraits, for example, accommodates both a rare daguerreotype from 1840—a photograph taken by Henry Fitz, Jr., of his own face, his eyes closed as if he were asleep—and a marvellously detailed ink-jet print by Bryan Schutmaat, which dates from 2010. Titled “Paul, Bozeman, Montana,” it depicts a guy at a bar, in a blue T-shirt and jeans. His lost and rheumy gaze, like the lines on his forehead and the gray grizzle of his beard, makes you wonder what troubles the poor fellow hasn’t seen, and sends your thoughts irrepressibly to the second floor of the Rijksmuseum, where the brow of Rembrandt, visible in his “Self-Portrait as the Apostle Paul,” from 1661, is equally riven with care. The two men could be brothers, although only one of them holds a glass of beer.

In geographical terms, too, “American Photography” roams free. We see everything from the cover of a Holiday magazine—the issue of December, 1955, complete with palm trees, Christmas gifts, and the optimistic tagline “You’ll want to go to Florida when you read Budd Schulberg’s brilliant report”—to an amazing shot of what appears to be the surface of a crater-studded moon. In fact, it’s a view of the Yucca Flat nuclear-testing site, in Nevada, taken in 1996, and the craters were formed not by ancient meteor strikes but by the subsidence that follows a detonation underground. There’s also a fine quartet of New York street scenes, including “Emigrants, Queer man & Baggage, South Ferry, Manhattan,” which was taken by Alice Austen, in 1896. As visitors to the Alice Austen House, in Staten Island, will be aware, Austen rewards further investigation, and I only wish that the Rijksmuseum had found room for “Trude & I masked, short skirts,” from 1891, in which Austen photographs herself and a friend smoking at each other. It’s like a Diane Arbus setup, seventy years in advance.

The sorriest sight in the exhibition is both wide-ranging and highly specific, covering a lot of ground in one day. On June 8, 1968, the photographer Paul Fusco was on the train that bore the body of Robert Kennedy, who had been assassinated three days before, from New York to Washington. Fusco was working for Look magazine, and what he looked at, through his lens, were those who gathered beside the railroad tracks to pay their respects. Here, in pieces, was mourning in America. At the Rijksmuseum, however, we get not just a resonant Fusco shot but something else—photographs taken by the public, as the cortège drew near or trundled past. The snapshots (just a few of the many that have been patiently tracked down and assembled by the Dutch artist Rein Jelle Terpstra) are square in format and awkwardly composed. The colors have faded to a kind of sifted haze. Does memory degrade in the same way, or do the people who watched the train go by, fifty-seven years ago, still see it, as crisp as painted livery, in their mind’s eye?

If you are a New Yorker, you may have seen those snapshots before. In 2018, they were displayed in “RFK Funeral Train: the People’s View,” at the International Center of Photography. What makes them stand out at the Rijksmuseum, energized afresh, is that they set the tone for the whole enterprise. The exhibit was conceived in 2017, and the curators, Mattie Boom and Hans Rooseboom, made it a matter of principle, while borrowing from other institutions, to amass material from private collections and auction houses, too. “There is no other land where photography is so closely entwined with the course of its history,” Boom writes in the exhibition catalogue, and the result of that entwining is a wealth of visual stuff—a sun-warmed advertisement for Motorola radios, endorsed by the married actors Dick Powell and June Allyson, from the pages of Life, or a crumpled mini-portrait from a photo booth. In neither case do we know the photographer’s identity. Here is a haven for the amateur, the anonymous, and the forgotten.

The concluding section of the show, it’s true, is dedicated to the proposition that “Photography Becomes Art,” and it proves the point with Sally Mann’s grandly beautiful closeup of her daughter’s face (2004), and with two semi-abstract nudes (1918-19), tightly cropped, by Charles Sheeler. Yet the rest of the exhibition urges us to question what, exactly, is so fine about fine art, and what can get missed or ignored in the quest for finesse. Twenty years or more after Sheeler produced those nudes, he shot the photographs for a leaflet, “Souvenir of Your Trip Through the Ford Rouge Plant.” That leaflet is laid out, in all its dull splendor, in an earlier room.

In a similar vein, we see a 1961 poster for Texas highways (“Over 60,000 miles of motoring adventure”) replete with images by nameless photographers. More casual, and far more intimate, is the arsenal of gun shots—regular Americans, children as well as adults, toting their weaponry for the camera, and for the nervous amusement of their friends and relatives. My favorite picture in the show is a peace offering, from 1907, which has the force of a compacted short story: two young women in high collars and hats, next to which someone has scribbled, “This was taken after I had a fight with my best.” And the very first thing you see, as you enter the exhibition, is not a flat image at all but an object: a homemade cube built from strips of folded Marlboro packs, with a space on each side for a photograph. Each space is filled by the face of a young African American. Somebody, somewhere, took the time to construct this delicate shrine to companionship.

The cube was found in a flea market by a New York collector, whose trove of discoveries came to the notice of Rooseboom and Boom. “We went to a warehouse in Brooklyn and it was all there,” Boom told me. (It’s always a warehouse in Brooklyn.) Some of what they unearthed in the course of their searching bears careful inspection. We see a church fan, say, from 1967, with a paddle made of card; on one side is an advertisement for Hart Funeral Service, of Asheville, North Carolina, and on the other is a portrait of Martin Luther King, Jr. What, you might ask, is the fan doing here? Well, to borrow a distinction from mathematics, the emphasis throughout the show is more on applied photography than on pure photography—on the uses, from the celebratory to the bitter and the whimsical, to which the medium has been put.

The nation that emerges from “American Photography,” in short, is not just a powerhouse of moral, commercial, and political purpose but an engine for repurposing. This can be performed with wit; for a New York-themed issue of Flair magazine, in 1950, Saul Steinberg decorates photographs of the city with a frolic of lines and figures, transforming it into a playground. A chest of drawers is transformed into a skyscraper, as if by a wizard’s charm. At the other extreme, consider a photograph of a formerly enslaved Black man, from around 1863. He is shown from behind, with one arm crooked and his head turned in profile: a formal pose, the better to show the network of scars, like the roots of a tree, that cover his bare back. To how many floggings they testify one can barely imagine. The picture is tiny, and with good reason, because it was, in fact, deployed as a carte de visite—handed out by abolitionists as an efficient means of conveying the evils of slavery. This combination of polite social convenience and deep wounds, designed to shock the system, continues to shock the eye.

Even for the big names, the distinction between the pure and the pragmatic holds fast. Robert Mapplethorpe is here, as you’d expect, with two self-portraits, one of them so nakedly puckish that it verges on the diabolical; yet what sticks with you, in another room, is a picture that he took of the band Television for the cover of their début album, “Marquee Moon,” in 1977. Thanks in part to a jarring adjustment of the colors, they look like alien immigrants suffering from space lag. (Two years earlier, Mapplethorpe had been responsible for the black-and-white shot of Patti Smith that adorned her album “Horses.” Could it be the most widely distributed image in the Mapplethorpe corpus?) Likewise, a famous Walker Evans photograph from 1936, “Main Street of County Seat, Alabama,” is displayed not in its original form but in a later incarnation, as the basis of a wartime poster in 1942. Any stillness and tension have been dispelled; the photograph has been blown up and colorized, with a line of green trees added in the background and a yellow banner pasted across the top—“This is America . . .” Down at the bottom the slogan is completed: “. . . Keep it Free!”

Free enterprise, free expression, free trade, freedom of movement, the freedom to vote, and also the freedom to quash and to destroy: such are the liberties that are examined and interrogated by “American Photography.” To say the least, it’s quite a moment for such a show. For the first time since the Second World War, the bedrock of understanding between the United States and Europe has begun to crack. Mark Rutte, who was the Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 2010 to 2024, is now the secretary-general of NATO, an organization that President Trump regards with an indifference bordering on contempt. Nobody at the Rijksmuseum could have foreseen the cultural ground shifting so rapidly underfoot. To be sure, a single exhibition will change little, and solve even less, but inviting young Europeans to look at the varieties of American experience on the walls of the Rijksmuseum is, you could argue, one way to gauge whether, and for how long, they will still look to the United States, as a destination and a dream.

Should they require a particular role model, “American Photography,” ever helpful, can supply that, too. In 1851, a Dutchman, Walther van Erven Dorens, emigrated from Amsterdam to San Francisco. There, he joined a fire brigade as a volunteer, and a daguerreotype preserves his pride in the appointment. He stands in uniform, with one hand on his hip and another on a ladder—a tool of his perilous trade. He has made the odyssey from the Old World to the New, in pursuit of a better life. Whether he has found it, and how he will flourish, there is no way of knowing. His eyes give nothing away.♦"

MSC Cruises now offers the largest cruise port in the world.
MSC Cruises opened the world’s largest cruise terminal on Saturday, April 5, 2025, at PortMiami. It now serves as the home port for MSC Cruises’ new flagship, MSC World America, which will bring cruisers to the Caribbean.
Miami has been called the Cruise Capital of the World. Formally known as the Dante B. Fascell Port of Miami, PortMiami is situated at the mouth of the Miami River. It’s the biggest passenger port in the world, and now it is setting a new industry benchmark with this new cruise terminal. Here’s how the new terminal is changing the ways cruisers embark on a ship and prepare for their time at sea.
The new terminal is also the first to provide cruisers with a total biometric journey. It utilizes digital identity verification for an easier embarkation process. Built by Fincantieri Infrastructure and designed by Arquitectonica, the 492,678 square foot cruise terminal will be able to process as many as 36,000 MSC Cruises passengers in a single day.
This was developed to make things easier for guests. Let’s face it. The old way of checking in for a cruise could be exhausting, but this new process was developed to help make embarkation less stressful and more fun for cruisers.
Guests who have opted into the biometric journey will be asked to scan their passport and look into the camera of one of the biometric face pods which will then validate their information. There are then 20 security lanes for guests to help complete the embarkation process.
Lastly, guests go through a biometric e-gate. That’s the final step on the embarkation process that verifies each guest, and cruisers are then free to enjoy the ship and get started on their vacation.
MSC Cruises will continue to take cruisers to exciting destinations from PortMiami.
Perhaps the most striking part of the new cruise terminal is the art exhibition that will be on display for all to enjoy. The art is not what you might expect. It is displayed in various places, including on the floor and over the terminal itself.
The commissions of these innovative public artworks were created as part of a collaboration between PortMiami, Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs, Art in Public Places Program and MSC. Miami-Dade County Art in Public Places is a program of the Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs, and it was established in 1973 as one of the first public art programs in the country.
Here are some of the unique pieces that are on display at the terminal for all to enjoy:
In addition to these artworks, additional exclusive art is on display at the terminal within the MSC Yacht Club private lounge."

The current gallery space will close this May, and the renovations will take approximately two years to complete. Upon reopening, the Burberry Gallery will continue showcasing five centuries of fashion, and it will host a suite of “onsite, offline, and online” programs aiming to enrich fashion education.

Joshua Schulman, Burberry’s CEO, said, “Burberry’s partnership with the V&A marks a milestone moment for British arts and culture. It unites two centuries-old cultural icons with a shared legacy of heritage and innovation, and a commitment to championing creativity. We are so thrilled to come together with the V&A team to celebrate the rich history of fashion and to develop an immersive space that will inspire creative minds for generations to come.”

Notably, Burberry’s designs have been displayed in several exhibitions at the V&A Museum, including Fashioned From Nature, Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear, and NAOMI: In Fashion.

The V&A’s Fashion Gallery will close on Sunday, May 4, to undergo renovations, and it will reopen in spring 2027. The museum’s fashion collection will still be accessible via V&A East Storehouse, which opens on May 31."

At nearly 600 pages, including the game’s complete screenplay — and more than a dozen bonus trinkets in the Deluxe Edition — Lost in Cult’s upcoming Immortality: Design Works isn’t the sort of book you fit neatly into your collection; it’s the sort of book you build a collection around.

The fifth entry in the U.K. publisher’s Design Works series, the Immortality book dives deep into one of Polygon’s favorite games of 2022, the FMV game that answers the question, “What happened to Marissa Marcel?” Mixing artwork with archival photos, interviews, and analysis, Immortality: Design Works will be shipping soon, so we reached out to get a bit more detail on what to expect.

As part of an effort to spotlight game-related books and documentaries, Polygon is running an email interview series with the people behind them. Check out the full list to read up on an Untitled Goose Game book, a Housemarque documentary, and others. Below, Immortality: Design Works book author Chris Schilling discusses the game, thermo-reactive ink, and Lost in Cult’s highest page count to date.

Polygon: The book looks like it includes a bit of everything. What percentage is the game’s script and what percentage is writing about the game, artwork, etc.?

Chris Schilling: It’s hard to break down into percentages; suffice it to say that the complete Immortality screenplay alone runs to more than 400 pages. The rest comprises a detailed oral history, interspersed with features covering individual aspects of production — from how Half-Mermaid and crew achieved a period-perfect look for three fictional films to the game’s haunting sound design. In total, it’s close to 600 pages, making it Lost In Cult’s biggest individual book to date.

The store listing mentions “thermo-reactive ink that responds to the heat of your hands.” Can you explain how that works and what’s hidden in there?

That would be telling! We’d like readers to discover it for themselves, but the description basically says it all — if you place your hands on certain pages, you’ll reveal what’s hidden beneath the surface. It works if you hold a flame nearby, too, though we wouldn’t advise that!

What’s an obscure detail most people wouldn’t know that you learned about the game while working on the book?

Because of the game’s intricate nature, and how the scenes are interconnected, all the actors had to stick very closely to the script. But there was one moment where an accident forced a particular actor to ad-lib a line, which was so good it was kept in. It’s a really funny anecdote, so readers should look out for that one. Also, one of the production team [members] made an unexpected cameo in the game that no one knows about; again, I’ll preserve the surprise for the book. The last thing I’ll add is that you’ll learn at least as much about the filmmaking process as the game part — just about everyone I spoke to offered illuminating insights into their roles, but chatting with the game’s BAFTA-nominated costume designer Kerry Hennessy was a particular treat: that has to be one of the most enjoyable interviews I’ve ever done.

At a glance, it looks like the Deluxe Edition has about 15 items in the box. Anything you wanted to include that you weren’t able to?

At Lost In Cult we’re always keen to push the boat out and give our readers as much bang for their buck as possible. As a writer, I invariably feel like I could have done more — but extending the page count further could have made an already massive book quite unwieldy! I think the Deluxe Edition makes for a pretty comprehensive package — especially the in-fiction extras which provide some telling extra details. In particular, Manon Gage’s in-character script annotations as Marissa Marcel will be catnip for Immortality fans; discussing those with her was one of my personal highlights of the project.

Police seized four of Mann’s photographs from the Diaries of Home exhibit held at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in January after a complaint was made the images constituted child pornography.

But last week a grand jury declined to take action against Mann and the case was closed.

In response to the furor, Texas House Representative David Lowe, a North Richland Hills Republican, has filed House Bill 3958 which would create a civil penalty against museums that exhibit “certain obscene or harmful material.”

Fort Worth Report notes the bill characterizes obscenity as materials or performances that depict sexual conduct in an offensive way that lack literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

“It establishes that museums displaying such material in violation of specified sections of the Penal Code could face a civil penalty of up to $500,000 for each item displayed and for each day the display continues,” a summary of the bill reads.

“The Attorney General is granted the authority to seek injunctive relief, impose civil penalties, and recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs associated with the investigation or litigation.”

That means had the museum faced charges under this bill, it could have been fined $2 million for the photos plus whatever attorney fees a court decided it should pay.

Lowe tells Fort Worth Report that he sponsored the bill specifically because of Mann’s photos and was critical of the exhibit after a report appeared on conservative news website The Dallas Express.

“The bill was introduced because the protection of children is paramount and I am committed to doing everything within my power to safeguard them,” Lowe says in a statement.

“The situation involving actual nude photos of minors, not mere artistic depictions, displayed at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth spurred me into action. We must dedicate ourselves to protecting children from any institution that might seek to harm or exploit them under the pretense of art.”

The images in question are from Mann’s 1992 book Immediate Family which features nude photos of the photographer’s children. A reporter from The Dallas Express shared photos from the Modern Art of Fort Worth Museum showing a naked girl jumping on a table and a boy with liquid running down his body.

Mann is one of the most famous image-makers of her generation. Her intimate, large-format portraits of family life in Virginia have made her a star of the photography world. But her photos have attracted controversy before, in 2015 the photographer revealed that a federal prosecutor warned her that eight of her photos she selected for an exhibit could subject her to arrest.

Mann defended herself: writing in an article that “all too often, nudity, even that of children, is mistaken for sexuality, and images are mistaken for actions.”

She continued, “The image of the child is especially subject to that kind of perceptual dislocation; children are not just the innocents that we expect them to be… But in a culture so deeply invested in a cult of childhood innocence, we are understandably reluctant to acknowledge these discordant aspects or, as I found out, even fictionalized depictions of them.”

Chloe Kempf, staff attorney at the ACLU of Texas, tells Fort Worth Report that the legislation put forward by Rep. Lowe is a threat to the constitutionally protected right to artistic expression in the state.

“As we recently witnessed with the attempted censorship of Sally Mann, legislation like this seeks to intimidate artists and curators through baseless investigations of, and penalties against, our artistic communities,” Kempf tells the news media outlet. “The people of Texas, not government officials, should have the freedom to decide what forms of art we want to view and support.”

If the bill is passed and signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, House Bill 3958 would take effect September 1."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The Art House Tacheles used to be the epicentre of the alternative art and culture scene in Berlin, an impressive five-storey building in the heart of the capital dating back to 1908 and occupied by artists after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

But in 2012 the raves were over and the artists were kicked out when the building was sold to a New York investor and renovated to make room for apartments, offices, stores, a supermarket and a Swedish photography museum.

For Oliver Putzbach, a 52-year-old Berlin native who used to live nearby, Tacheles' transformation symbolises that of the capital itself.

While its economy grows and investment capital pours in, long-time residents like Putzbach fear it is losing its edgy character and bohemian charm that had its former mayor famously declaring over two decades ago that Berlin was “poor but sexy.""

""It looks the same as a typical train station in Germany ...just like a mall,"" Putzbach said about the building he remembers as a multicultural village where he used to perform with his band Beat Organization three times a week.

""Berlin has sold its soul,"" he said.

For decades, Berlin stood out among European capitals, poorer than the rest of the country because of its unique history as a divided city and its costly reunification.

For the past 10 years, however, the capital's growth has outpaced the sluggish overall performance of Europe's largest economy.

Last year, Berlin's economy grew by 0.8% while the national one contracted for the second year in a row, data showed on Friday. As a result, Berlin's economic output per capita, which long lagged that of Germany, moved further above the national average, with 54,607 euros and 50,819 euros, respectively.

""Berlin was not wealthy, but that became the foundation for getting richer: Berlin attracted young talent who came here to reshape their lives and make their ideas reality,"" said Martin Gornig, researcher at the German Institute for Economic Research DIW Berlin.

The city has become Germany's startup capital, overtaking Munich with around 500 companies founded each year, and digital consumer services companies, such as e-commerce group Zalando or fintech N-26, calling Berlin home.

Tesla's gigafactory about an hour away and the city's new airport that opened in 2020 after multiple delays, also brought thousands of new jobs to the area.

Berlin's unique blend of high culture, counterculture and history has also made it a major tourism destination, Europe's third behind London and Paris in terms of overnight stays."

Primarily, McGinnis is best known for creating the poster art to various James Bond films over the decades. Beginning with 1965’s Thunderball, he’d go on to create art for You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Live and Let Die, and the 1967 parody version of Casino Royale. His film career extends beyond the spy franchise: in total, he did over 40 movie posters, such as Breakfast at Tiffany’s (his debut assignment) Barbarella and three Matt Helm films. As he became more popular, “the McGinnis Woman” became a popular shorthand to describe the figure of bikini-clad women that were often paired with chiseled men of that era.

Born February 3, 1926, McGinnis is described by Legacy as “one of the most prolific illustrators of the 20th century.” Starting out in his career, he apprenticed at Walt Disney Studios and later took a job at Dell Publishing. There, he drew covers for paperback novels for various genres, from detective fiction to horror and fantasy. His work could also be seen in magazines such as National Geographic, TIME, and Reader’s Digest. In 2016, he started drawing retro covers for reissued Neil Gaiman books.

McGinnis is survived by his three children and their individual families."

HONOLULU - Kamea Hadar paints the tallest mural in Hawaii at 220 feet tall and 25 stories.
We’ve grown accustomed to seeing murals dominate cityscapes, as building owners around the world partner with artists to beautify and personalize blank spaces, big and small.
While all art pieces add something special to a city or community, some stand out for their sheer size or embedded meaning.
In the case of a new record-breaking mural that was just painted on the island of Oʻahu in Hawaiʻi, both are true.
Kamea Hadar recently completed what has become Hawaiʻi’s tallest mural, measuring about 220 feet tall and spanning 25 stories of a large Honolulu skyscraper. The mural took months of planning, according to Hadar, but only four days to paint.
The size of the mural in itself is a great feat, but the story behind the artwork, its connection to the purpose of the building, and the message the artwork sends to residents of the building make it extra special.
The mural is painted on Nāulu Tower in Honolulu, a new affordable housing project that’s set to help local families struggling to afford the high cost of living in Hawaiʻi.
“It’s going to be Hawaiʻi’s new record-breaking tallest mural,” Hadar told local news station KHON2. “Affordable housing for over 300 families in Hawaiʻi, that just kind of makes it doubly special for me.”
The subject of the artwork is an Iwa bird—a Hawaiian seabird—that has historically been used by the Hawaiian people as a sign of life, safety, and navigation when out on the water.
“I thought that the Iwa bird would be a perfect fit for that because it was used by sailors to navigate,” Hadar told KHON2. “When they’re out at sea, you know that the water and weather is calm, and that’s why they’re flying out there. So, they’re kind of like one of the oceans telltale signs of land, weather, rain… et cetera.”
The idea of painting a bird with such traditional meaning on a building set to house families who may be going through turbulent times is a nice message, signaling that calm waters are just ahead.
When visiting Oʻahu, you can find the new mural on the outskirts of Honolulu, in an area called Hālawa.
Here’s the exact address for the building. It’s adjacent to the Pearl Harbor Memorial, so very convenient to check out on your way to or from the National Historic Site.
When visiting, be aware and courteous to traffic—never block a roadway or stop in a dangerous place—and be respectful of local residents."

Based between Berlin and New Zealand, Grosse has spent over three decades redefining what painting can be, moving beyond the canvas to embrace entire landscapes, buildings and sculptural form.

For Grosse, a painting has no end nor edge. Using her signature spray technique, she sweeps pigment across surfaces in immersive dreamlike waves whose borderless forms create a harmonic unity. “For me, two-dimensional painting doesn’t exist,” the artist explained. “The canvas itself is a three-dimensional, haptic object and a painting can appear anywhere. On an egg, in the crook of your arm, in snow and ice or on the beach.”

Circling this philosophy are three new works, produced especially for the show. Among them is the titular piece, The Sprayed Dear, which references the golden stag atop the museum and plays on the word “dear” as something treasured. Also on view are Ghost, a massive white styrofoam sculpture exploring surface and shape, and Untitled, which reveals the sculptural soul of Grosse’s canvas paintings. Complementing these works are rarely seen early sculptures from her student years at the Düsseldorf Art Academy, shedding light on a lesser-known dimension of her practice.

Alongside the exhibition, Grosse’s magnetic color fields will be the focus of this year’s Messeplatz Project at Art Basel’s marquee fair in June.

The Sprayed Dear is now on view in Stuttgart through January 2026.

Room 8 is a room in Blue Prince that you can only unlock with Key 8 on rank 8. You’ll find that key by solving the Gallery puzzle(s).

In Room 8, you’ll have to puzzle out clues on eight animal statues and place them in eight bins labeled with sins.

Our Blue Prince guide will show you how to solve the Room 8 puzzle and tell you what you get as a reward.

How to solve the Room 8 puzzle in Blue Prince

Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

Room 8 is a pretty exact match for the final painting in the Gallery. You’ll find a big infinity symbol in the center of the room surrounded by bins labeled with sins. There’s a painting of a fin on the left wall, and a rug (skin) on the floor (those are both clues you’ll need).

To the left of the door as you walk in, you’ll find eight animal statues with phrases on them.

Image: Dogubomb/Raw Fury via Polygon

Solving the puzzle in Room 8 is a simple (ha!) as placing the eight animal statues in the boxes their clue describes. Several of them have clues that point to multiple bins, though.

The clues are:

Penguin : The sum of my sin, as it is penned, is a number within the room we are in

Lion : To first begin, place me within a bin with an “N” within its sin

Swan : I recommend you think again if I am ever in a bin far from the fin

Dog : You won’t find my bin in between sin, for I deserve to be in a bin down on the end

Elephant : To my chagrin, my neighbor’s sin is written thin to fit it all in

Rabbit : I share a trend with my neighbor’s sin: a letter and its twin appear on each bin

Bear : If we spend a min or ten lounging in the den, you’ll know which bin I’m often in

Monkey: The bin I tend to wind up in is near the bend in the tail of the skin

Room 8 solution in Blue Prince

You have to jump around a bit, but the list of clues only has one answer when you take them all together.

Four of the clues point to only one bin:

Penguin - GLUTTONY . This is the only sin with eight (sideways infinity) letters.

Monkey - HUBRIS . The bin next to the tail of the skin (rug).

Dog - MUNDANITY . Since the Monkey is in HUBRIS, the Dog has to go in MUNDANITY at the other end of the row of bins.

Bear - SLOTH. The bear’s clue is all about just hanging out and relaxing.

With those four in place, you can place two more:

Lion - ENVY . With those three out of the way, only one empty sin has an “N.”

Swan - LUST. This is the only bin left that is close to the painting of the fin.

The last two have a bit more logic involved:

Rabbit - AVARICE . AVARICE is next to MUNDANITY — which both have a repeated (twin) letter (A and N, respectively).

Elephant - WRATH. Aside from being the only empty bin, AVARICE is next to Gluttony with its (fittingly) narrow letters.

Tell us about your upbringing in Chicago and how your experiences living there have shaped your work.

I am actually from North Georgia. I was born in Orlando, but moved to Georgia at the end of elementary school where I spent most of my adolescence. I moved to Chicago in 2016 to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). Chicago definitely feels like home these days; I have found such a welcoming community within the arts and with the super genuine people who live here. It’s nice that Chicago is broken up into neighborhoods to where if you’d like you can have a chill, homey vibe, or there is always something going on if you want to get into something artsy or fun. And the food here is amazing.

Your sculptures predominantly feature Black and Brown individuals, oftentimes, in raw and nude portrayals. How important is it for you to champion marginalized voices through sculpture and why?

Yes, I mostly depict Black and Brown people because I am trying to pull from my own experiences as a Black Latina. I think it’s so important especially for kids learning about art because how often in the American education system do young Black and Brown Americans actually see themselves in ‘fine art’? It was definitely hard for me to relate to art history, particularly with sculpture, since I mostly learned about Greek and Roman figures. It wasn’t until I started attending SAIC that I was exposed to works that inspire and influence me to this day including Mesoamerican ceramics, as well as the works of artists like Simone Leigh, Hebru Brantley, Rose B. Simpson, and En Iwamura. All strong contemporary artists working in the realm of figurative sculpture.

Describe your earliest works and how your subject matter has evolved over time. Also, when and how did you create the signature look of your pieces?

I started making art at a young age as many children do, drawing and doodling. I loved cartoons and comics, so that really has influenced the cartoony, non-realistic look of my ceramic figures to this day. I really liked shows like Batman Beyond, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Naruto. I started doing ceramic work during college at the suggestion of some of my professors. I applied to SAIC with a figurative painting portfolio, but luckily the school pushes for artists to work in a more interdisciplinary manner. My freshman year I got into sculpture and ceramics classes and really haven’t looked back since. I think the world of clay is so easy to get lost in, it’s a very enchanting material. When I started getting into clay I was mainly making busts and naked semi-realistic figures. Some of my professors pushed me to make works based off of my cartoony drawings, so basically my signature look comes from translating my drawings to ceramic figures."

This informs how she sees and interprets the world: “Illustration is another way for me to explore ideas,” she explains. Her colourful and tactile images often blur the lines between play and poetry, combining familiar symbols from our everyday lives into abstract compositions.

Originally trained in ink drawing, Zoé now works digitally, layering scanned textures in Procreate to retain an analogue mood. She’s worked on editorial and publishing projects with clients like Penguin Random House, Cosmopolitan Italia, Bon Appetit, and Little White Lies. Her work draws from an eclectic pool of influences – from Art Nouveau glasswork to 70s album covers, and Japanese teen magazines to 1930s fashion.

As for subject matter, “I naturally gravitate toward food, plants, animals, and human behaviour,” she says. “Lately, I’ve been obsessed with illustrating perfume.” This sensory dimension runs throughout her illustrations, from swirling shapes that echo the movement of scent, to compositions that feel dreamlike yet grounded – anchored by familiar items like handbags, vegetables or pets. “Plants and animals allow me to tell a story or set an atmosphere without relying on human representation,” she says. “It allows for a more poetic or symbolic approach.”"

Both became famous for their canvas paintings, rather than murals, which was Mexico’s defining artistic expression at the time. While Kahlo’s notable relationship was with Diego Rivera, Izquierdo’s was with Rufino Tamayo, both men known for painting on canvas and walls.

In 1945, Izquierdo was offered the opportunity to paint a large mural in Mexico City’s government headquarters, potentially making her the first female Mexican artist to undertake such a public commission. However, the offer was rescinded, and Izquierdo passed away in 1955 without ever creating a similar mural.

Izquierdo is also known for her damning quote: “It is a crime to be born a woman, it’s an even greater crime to be born a woman with talent.” The statement hints at the suspected reasons behind the cancellation of her proposed mural. Some believe that Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco—Mexico’s three most prominent muralists—led a boycott against her. Izquierdo’s sketches for the mural, depicting Mexico City’s history from its Indigenous roots to its post-Industrial Revolution social ideals, almost exclusively featured women. Despite previous collaborations with female artists, like the U.S.-born sisters Marion and Grace Greenwood, the male muralists disapproved of this concept and dismissed Izquierdo as “incapable and inexperienced,” resulting in the mural’s cancellation.

In 2021, curator Dea López sought to revive Izquierdo’s project on an exterior wall in the city of Oaxaca. On March 8th (International Women’s Day), 110 volunteers—mostly women—gathered to recreate the sketch at large scale, with a few variations. While Izquierdo’s original concept included a few men, this new version exclusively featured female characters, to affirm its feminist intentions. Over the course of four days, they completed their work, which now prominently displays its title: “El Mural Que Debió Ser” (The Mural That Should Have Been)."

A visit to the marble-covered Apple Via del Corso is an Apple Store experience that offers unexpected artwork and masses of culture. AppleInsider visited the store to check out the mix of old and new.

Apple Via del Corso opened as Apple's 17th store in Italy back in 2021. It's one of three storefronts in Rome itself, the only non-mall style store in the city, and it's an extremely impressive location for the iPhone seller.

As part of our periodic tours of Apple Stores around the world, one member of the AppleInsider editorial team paid a visit to the store while in the region.

The day of the visit in early April was on a fairly warm afternoon, after miles of sightseeing. A few minutes walk away from the extremely tourist-filled Trevi Fountain, the Apple Via del Corso was shown on Google Maps to be busier than usual, leaving little hope for a quiet visit.

That turned out to be far from the reality, as there were relatively few people visible at Apple Via del Corso. There were more staff members on the floor than customers.

A modernized classic

From the outside, the store fits in seamlessly with the rest of the area. A chunky front facade surrounds giant glass panels, which give a peek into the store while also letting in vast amounts of light.

One of Apple Via del Corso's downstairs sales rooms

However, unlike other stores that made their signage more prominent at street level, Apple's lit logo appears above the tall glass doors, within the alcove. While it's a big and prominent store for Apple, it's also not hard for people to miss it while walking by.

It's a muted start to the shopping experience, but one that immediately becomes familiar once you get inside.

You are greeted with large marble rooms at the ground level. Light grey and almost white marble stretches across the floor and up the walls, stretching to the ceiling filled with inset lights.

A second downstairs room in Apple Via del Corso

The giant windows from the outdoors prove their worth by letting light in, and are set into quite deep alcoves around the edges.

All of the grey and white also contrasts against the wooden product cabinets and desks that are traditional of Apple. You can certainly tell it's an Apple Store, but it's a style that's very different to the environment it's set in.

It's as if someone placed an Ikea Lack table in the Oval Office of the White House. It's functional, but not what you would otherwise expect based on the location.

The store is not just a few large rooms on the ground floor, as it leads off into a few other areas.

The Apple Via del Corso courtyard

Downstairs also houses a courtyard in the middle of the building, complete with a collection of Camphora trees. They're lined up beside columns and hanging lamps, and is an inviting area it hang out in for a bit of peace and quiet.

You can also see other vines and trees on an upper terrace, which adds to the space.

Looking up within the Apple Via del Corso courtyard

Connecting the rooms are small marble-lined corridors with large glass doors. However, you can also go upstairs to more spaces via an extremely grand marble staircase.

The main staircase of Apple Via del Corso

Looking up as you climb, you'll see decorative features on the ceiling, around the skylight.

It's not quite the same as the Sistine Chapel, but it's still nice to look at. Considerably less crowded too.

Upstairs is the Forum, which includes spaces for the Genius Bar and Today at Apple presentations. Again, all clad with marble floors and a lot of wood furniture on a light background.

Cultural additions

The appeal of Apple Via del Corso isn't just that it's an Apple Store. Alongside the typical product-laden desks and cabinetry on the sides, as well as the large glass windows and panels, the store also heavily nods at the building's cultural history.

The building itself, Palazzo Marignoli was originally constructed in 1873, designed by architect Salvatore Bianchi and renovated by Giulio Podesti. It housed Caffe Aragno, a well-known gathering place for artists and writers in the city, and is home to a number of pieces of art.

Fabio Cipolla's ""Dawn""

With a strong connection to art and culture, it's no wonder that Apple's refurbishment team put a lot of work into making the store as stunning as possible. The team also made an effort to restore artworks incorporated into the store itself, thanks to local restorers.

In the ceiling downstairs, you'll find restorations of artworks including Fabio Cipolla's ""Dawn"" and Ettore Ballerini's ""Dusk."" While in the ceiling, they're still large, easy to see, and a very unexpected addition to the Apple Store.

Ettore Ballerini's ""Dusk""

The walls also have artworks on them, though of a more abstract variety. Brown panels with decorative scratches around the store turn out to be graffiti by Italian painter Afro Basaldella in the 1950s.

Given the overall surroundings of the Apple Store location itself, the heavy use of marble and light-colored walls, and the unique artworks on display, Apple has arguably made a mini-museum experience. One that could even please art lovers waiting as their loved ones pick up a new iPhone.

An oasis of calm

As a flagship store, you would expect Apple Via del Corso to be an extremely busy and spectacular location. It's certainly the case that it's an impressive storefront for the company, but it's also one that offers a feeling of calmness.

Tons of marble went into that staircase

Though we were lucky to turn up on a day with relatively few people in-store, despite it being in the region of multiple high-traffic tourist locations, it feels like it would be a reasonably quiet shopping experience even when full. The tall ceilings and the reverberations from the marble gives off a feeling of being in a museum, enough to possibly encourage people to minimize noise.

Even entering the store is an auditory change, from the busy and noisy streets outside to a more refined shopping experience inside.

Add in the existence of the tree-filled courtyard, and you have an Apple Store that feels part museum, part exhibit in its own right.

If the Apple Store doesn't do enough to be relaxing, there's always another option. There's a Starbucks around the back of the building that's also a cocktail bar."

In the dimly lit “printing cellar” of Media Museum and Archives Merkki is a remarkable and curious object. It’s a mosaic of tightly arranged brass rule and spacing material, made by a Finnish typographer Valto Malmiola in 1937. Note, it’s not a single piece of metal, and it’s neither engraved nor etched… it’s thousands of individual metal bits, pieced together by hand, and locked tightly into a frame for printing.

Figure 1. Forme for the Jean Sibelius print at the Media Museum and Archives Merkki.

When inked and pressed onto paper, it creates an image of the famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.

Figure 2. Portrait of Jean Sibelius, composed entirely of brass rule.

But, to me at least, the resulting image itself is not what’s interesting here. After all, it’s a fairly conventional portrait of Sibelius. What’s interesting and what makes the whole thing remarkable is how it’s made and how it came to be. It’s essentially a form of proto-ASCII art: intentionally (mis)using techniques and materials originally intended for printing text to create a complex image. What led to its creation? What is it anyway? Where did Malmiola get the idea to use letterpress in such an unconventional way?

The Use of Rules

Malmiola writes about the inspiration for the picture in the Finnish printing arts periodical Kirjapainotaito:

“When our renowned master composer Jean Sibelius turned 70 in 1935, [...] I was struck with a strange dream of trying to replicate his image using impractical typographic methods. I had previously seen pictures ""set"" with Monotype fonts and decorations in foreign graphic design trade journals, particularly ""The Inland Printer"", so I decided to try, but not with type and ornament, but with rule.

To give a bit of context, in letterpress printing, rules are strips of metal, often brass or type-cast metal, used for printing lines. They’ve been an integral part of printing since the early 1500’s.

Figure 3. Varying rule styles and thicknesses.

Rules are typically used for decoration, as a border around the edges of pages, or for creating simple designs on book covers or brochures. A variety of tones from light grey to solid black can be made by combining rules of different widths. Rules also have a functional use as dividers for adding structure and visual hierarchy in tables, catalogues, and other layouts.

Figure 4. A common use for brass rule. This is very familiar to us even today: think of spreadsheets.

Instead of using brass rules conventionally, Malmiola used them like building blocks. By carefully arranging rules of varying thicknesses in horizontal and vertical lines, he managed to make complex images.

Figure 5a. Closeup of the forme shows the individual elements and their positioning.

Figure 5b. Closeup of the print shows how the picture is formed after printing.

For those unfamiliar with letterpress techniques, or those who have never attempted to do a complex arrangement, the sheer insanity of Malmiola’s task might not be obvious.

Each element is carefully chosen or cut neatly into precise lengths and arranged in a way that leaves no air-gaps. Even the smallest unfilled space could lead to an unstable structure and make the whole thing unprintable. The level of precision, patience and skill needed to do what Malmiola did should should not be understated. How was it made?

The Construction of the Print

To plan the construction, Malmiola experimented with several approaches. He writes that the first attempt was a pitiful failure. The second attempt fared better. He came up with a “coding” system to classify different types of lines and spaces according to tonal values, by measuring the lights and shadows of the reference image, and marked each line with the resulting string of code. But he found the process too laborious and abandoned the idea. He also experimented with a “square system”, but doesn’t elaborate what he meant by that. My guess is that he tried using grid paper to map tonal values.

Unfortunately Malmiola doesn’t reveal his final method, but Paavo Haavi, who worked with Malmiola at K. K. Printing, says he used a one-to-one photographic enlargement of the reference image to help in the typesetting process . The reference Malmiola likely used is a photo of Jean Sibelius that appeared on the cover of Suomen Kuvalehti -magazine in 1925.

Figure 7. Cover of Suomen Kuvalehti -magazine which Malmiola used as a reference.

What’s clear, just by observing the image, is that Malmiola used what’s essentially a manual half-toning process by plotting the reference image into tonal values, which he then painstakingly constructed with brass rule, piece by piece. This kind of half-toning process is typically done by a photographic screen or some automated system, but Malmiola had to do it by hand. Where the reference image required a black area, Malmiola used a thick rule stacked tightly next to each other, and where a gray tone was required, he alternated between fine rules and spacers, creating illusions of various gray tones.

Figure 6. Closeup of the face shows how the various tones are constructed

The final print measures just 28 × 37,5 cm (~11"" × 14.7"" in.) but is crafted using a staggering 30 000 ciceros of brass rule (which equals to around 135 meters or ~442 feet) in addition to some spacers and quadrants for the white space.

Haavi also recounts that Malmiola presented the print to Sibelius in person, who reportedly exclaimed, “Tehän se vasta taiteilija olette!” , translating roughly to “Whose the true artist here!” Whether this was sincere or said tongue-in-cheek is not clear, but Sibelius signed the picture anyway and gave permission to include it in the prints, suggesting at least some level of validation and recognition for Malmiola.

Malmiola announced the finished piece in Kirjapainotaito and sold the prints for 10 mk (equivalent to about 4 € today, adjusted for inflation). Given the relatively small size of the Finnish typography scene at the time, there weren’t many who would actually appreciate such a print. The potential for profit was likely quite limited, so as an incentive, Malmiola sold the prints “for the benefit of war orphans” . But despite his efforts, Malmiola had difficulties in selling his prints. As Haavi notes, he had to resort to selling them on the streets of Helsinki and through newspaper ads for years after the print was made.

After Malmiola’s death, the original letterpress forme of the Sibelius-print was donated to the hand typesetters guild, and later on to the printing industry workers’ trade division, the Helsinki Print Workers’ Association (HKY). HKY sold prints of it, and used the profits to “enhance the professional skills of young people working in printing”. In 2015, HKY loaned the Sibelius forme to the Media museum and archive Merkki’s printing cellar, where it remains on public display.

Malmiola’s Other Prints

In addition to the Sibelius-print, Malmiola made at least four others.

1. Bullfinches pecking at rowan tree berries, print on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in 1938

In 1938, Malmiola created a print featuring bullfinches pecking at rowan tree berries for the 30th anniversary cover of the Kirjapainotaito magazine. Malmiola explained that the tree represents “the tree of professional knowledge”, while the birds symbolize the friends and readers associated with the Kirjapainotaito magazine.

Figure 8. Cover of Kirjapainotaito for February 1938

He writes about the making of it as follows:

“In this context, we dare to say a few words about the construction of this issue’s cover. Firstly, such a practice should not be pursued by anyone, but since people in the world have so many hobbies… The rowan berries are monotype ornaments the size of cicero em, turned upside down and vaguely shaped with a file to intentionally create a ragged feel. In nature, the birds’ backs are blue-gray, but by using semi-bold lines, the illusion of a third color is evident. […] The slightly incorrect alignment of colors is intentional and enhances the image’s ‘atmospheric content,’ and poor printing, if one generally knows how to print poorly, gives the picture a piquant effect. It remains for the reader to make the final judgment on the validity of the moods elicited by the ‘image’.

While the Sibelius print is quite dull in its precise imitation of the reference image, this artwork manages to take advantage of the unique properties of the technique. The inherent limitations in the material qualities of letterpress and brass rule, which result in sharp and square angles, gives the print almost a digital, or pixelated, look. What was, at the time, probably thought of as clumsy and naive, seems almost strikingly contemporary now. There is a nice balance between the rigid mechanical precision of typographic forms and the organic natural forms of the tree and birds, giving it a certain charm that’s missing in the Sibelius-print.

According to Haavi, the forme for this print was disassembled after printing to release the material back into use.

Figure 9. An original print can be found at the offices of Helsingin Kirjatyöntekijäin Yhdistys ry.

2. Lighthouse, print on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in 1939

In 1939, Malmiola’s pictorial typography had become well known among the readers of Kirjapainotaito.

Figure 10. Cover of Kirjapainotaito for November 1939

This print is a lot simpler than the previous ones he made, because Malmiola used a Monotype machine to make it, instead of composing the image with pre-made brass rules, like he had done earlier with the Sibelius-print. The Monotype machine also forced him to use only horizontal rules. The magazine includes a short description of the cover:

“The composer of the structure explains that the image was derived from the theme ‘the waves of time strike harshly.’ The line material used is from monotype casting, which explains why the image surface could be modified by even breaking the material, something that, of course, would not be acceptable or even permissible with ordinary lines.

He programmed the machine to cast custom-sized rules from type metal (= an alloy comprising lead, antimony, and tin). Unlike brass, type metal was bulk material and reusable. This meant that any errors could be corrected by melting the metal down for reuse, which made it a more cost-effective option than the expensive brass. The process, however, still demanded a lof of manual effort in hand-setting type and trimming the rules to the exact lengths needed to construct the image.

3. Carradale-print, 1942

In 1942 Malmiola finished another piece to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Finnish printing art.

Figure 11. Carradale, composed with 325 meters of Monotype rule

As far as I know, this is Malmiola’s largest print, measuring 45 × 53 cm (~18"" × 21"" in.) and uses an astonishing 72 000 ciceros of rule (around 325 meters or ~1 065 feet). Even though it was also made with a Monotype machine, and uses only horizontal rule, it took Malmiola 140 hours to complete.

Figure 13. Close-up of the print Figure 14. Close-up of the print

Even though Monotype machines make it possible to reuse the material, Malmiola’s wanted to preserve the layout, rather than melting it down. The type metal needed for the construction of the print was provided by the Valtioneuvoston kirjapaino (Government Printing Office), and not by Malmiola’s own employer, K. K. Printing, who probably lacked the required material (or the will to give it). Yet, according to Haavi, the forme was melted anyhow, after an apprentice dropped it on the floor.

Figure 12. The original photograph

The print is based on a photo by Allan C. Green of a four-masted steel barque named Carradale (which Malmiola incorrectly called a frigate), built in 1889. In 1914 the ship was sold to Finnish shipowner J. Tengström, and the photo appeared in various magazines at that time (see for example 1922 Nuori Voima № 48).

4. Forest-print, 1943

I don’t know much about the creation of this print, but I saw it for the first time when I visited the offices of Helsingin Kirjatyöntekijäin Yhdistys ry in Helsinki. This print also uses only horizontal rules, but the construction is much less precise than any of the others, resulting in some charming raggedness, which works well with the gloomy moon-lit forest scene.

Malmiola’s Inspiration for the Technique

Many Finnish typographers followed and read foreign typographic journals, which inspired new ideas and techniques. In the late 1920’s, pictorial typography had emerged as a new trend in Germany. This method of producing images became a trendy topic in typographic trade journals. For example, Arthur Grams’ article “Das Buchdrucker als Architekt” (“The Printer as an Architect”) in Typographische Mitteilungen in July 1929 writes about pictorial typography in a way that explains its potential in typesetting:

“Most colleagues are simply unaware of the wealth of forms, particularly elementary forms, concealed within the typesetting case. Yet, it is in these elementary forms that the full and grand allure of picture composition truly emerges; the elementary forms render it an expressive medium for the new demands of the era. They may occasionally appear somewhat grotesque; however, this should not discourage one from exploring their subtleties. We must endeavor to continuously uncover new facets in picture composition, because the elements it comprises are our elements: type! Type belongs to the printer! That is the essence and purpose of picture composition; it is from this perspective that one must consider the matter.

Figure 16. A 1923 German typographic trade journal showcasing the new Silhouette type ornament series by Ludwig Wagner Type Foundry. It was used primarily for pictorial typesetting.

This new style spread from Germany, and inspired typographers like Valto Malmiola. Malmiola experimented with this style as early as 1933, and advocated for its use in an article titled “Yritys ‘kujeilla’ asiallisesti” (“An Attempt to do ‘Trickery’ Earnestly”) in Kirjapainotaito for December 1933 . He agreed with the idea that typographic elements are not just laying out text, but could be used for artistic expression. This early experiment probably inspired Malmiola to attempt a more ambitious project later on, leading to the creation of the Sibelius-print.

Figure 17. Malmiola’s early experimentations in pictorial typesetting.

In 1937, when Malmiola wrote about the creation of the Sibelius-print in Kirjapainotaito, he mentioned having seen pictures typeset with Monotype fonts and decorations in The Inland Printer. There are not many pictures set with Monotype in The Inland Printer that would match the year 1934 or 1935, but I found this portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, composed of 17 000 monotype characters in the May 1935 edition:

Figure 18. Franklin D. Roosevelt, composed of 17 000 monotype characters in The Inland Printer for May, 1935

This image is not created with brass rule, but with dots and colons. The gray tones are not achieved by purely half-toning optical illusion, but by having a tinted background (originally green) in the shape of the head .

While this image matches Malmiola’s description, I suspect his actual inspiration might have been something else. In January 1936, Graafikko, another Finnish trade journal, featured work by a Viennese printer, Carl Fasol. Fasol had developed a method of printing which he called “Stigmatype” already as early as 1860. Some of the stigmatype prints resemble the style and method of construction of Malmiola’s prints. Fasol introduced his invention to the public in 1867 with typeset picture of flowers and a picture of Gutenberg. Both images were reveled and he gained recognition especially among typographers. Fasol turned this into a series of Album for Printing Art, and traveled around Europe selling them, including Finland. .

Figure 19. Carl Fasol’s print of Johannes Gutenber’s house, made almost 70 years before Malmiola’s Sibelius print.

As a side note: the article also mentions some of Fasol’s prints were donated to Suomen Kirjapainomuseo (Finnish Printing Press Museum), which never actually existed, but the material is currently in the archives of Tekniikan Museo (The Museum of Technology). I went to look for the prints, but sadly couldn’t find them.

Beyond Fasol, there are many other typographers who used rules and other type elements to create pictorial typography in various delightful ways. Just to name a few, there’s Georg Wolffger in 1670, Monpied and Moulinet in ~1840’s and a whole trend of bending and twisting rules into all kinds of shapes in the 1870 – 1890’s. A comprehensive exploration of this phenomena would be required to put Malmiola’s work into proper context, but falls outside the scope of this post.

What’s interesting, is that these early practitioners of pictorial typography had recognized the potential of using small, modular, pixel-like elements to construct images. It laid the groundwork for how we understand and manipulate images today by showing how complex images can be made from simple, repeating parts. These early techniques were the building blocks for modern digital imaging, influencing everything from 4-color offset printing to bitmap graphics.

But... Why?

Pictorial typesetting was not always met with enthusiasm. It was often dismissed as a gimmick or childish dabbling, not just by traditionalists, but also by the rising avantgarde of typography. Jan Tschichold’s hugely influential book The New Typography, published in 1928, strictly forbade the use of any decorative elements or pictorial compositions made with type elements.

“The New Typography has absolutely nothing to do with ‘pictorial’ typesetting (Bildsatz) which has become fashionable recently. In almost all its examples it is the opposite of what we are aiming for.

— Jan Tschichold in The New Typography

Traditionalists, on the other hand, wanted typography to follow the established norms and styles of classical printing. In Finland, V. A. Vuorinen, a member of the Kirjapainotaito editorial team wrote an article in April 1934 titled “Latomisvälinen kuvittamisesta” (“Illustrating with typesetting tools”). In it, he stated that since typesetters usually lack formal artistic training, they should stick to what they know: simple typographic layouts.

“Finally, it should be mentioned that, in my opinion, a cobbler should stick to his last. Illustration is such a demanding task that not everyone is capable of it. At least I have come to the conviction that if a typesetter uses all his means and strength to produce good, proper typography, the value and artistry of the work becomes many times better than just dreaming of images. […] Let pictorial typesetting be seen as a pastime that can be indulged in between more important tasks, but when it’s necessary to produce something quickly, let’s work with letters and proper arrangements if there are no ready-made picture plates available, and most often leave the doomed-to-fail typesetting with illustrative means to the side.

Both the avantgarde and traditionalists viewed typographic experimentation, like what Malmiola was doing, as ridiculous and detracting from the primary purpose of typography: clear communication.

Vuorio’s article might have been written as an indirect response to Malmiola’s “Yritys ‘kujeilla‘ asiallisesti” (“An Attempt to do ‘Trickery‘ Earnestly”) in Kirjapainotaito for December 1933 . In it, Malmiola suggests that the method of creating pictorial typography should be taken seriously. But even then, Malmiola often downplayed his art, referring to his practice as merely a “hobby”. Did he do so to shield himself, and his work, from being too harshly judged as unprofessional by his colleagues?

Malmiola wrote that this kind of work “ought to be executed using straightforward methods; the design should be presented with just a few outlines, and importantly, there needs to be a hint of humor, as too serious an attempt might end up being inadvertently comical.” These thoughts seem somewhat unexpected, especially when contrasted with Malmiola’s solemn portrayal of Sibelius. Maybe Malmiola wanted to prove that his method had real potential for serious and respectful artistic expression by choosing Sibelius as his subject. Maybe he wished that by making a portrait of the renowned composer Jean Sibelius on his 70th birthday would make the technique seem more professional than how it was percieved by others.

Whatever the case may be, Malmiola’s dedication appears to have been driven more by passion, curiosity, and enjoyment rather than by financial or other superficial motives. As noted by Haavi, at that time, many typesetters, including Malmiola, took great pride in their profession and were interested in the discourse happening on an international level . Malmiola was a frequent contributor to Kirjapainotaito, writing short articles and essays, especially about pictorial typesetting. In April 1933 Malmiola wrote an article titled “Mielikuvitus latojan apuna” (“Imagination as an Aid to a Typesetter’s Skills”) where he argued that typesetting, while not a traditional art, requires imagination and creativity to produce exceptional work, and most importantly, to find joy in the work . This seems to have been the case for Malmiola, as he worked on his “hobby” during his free time and quieter work periods.

However, I get a sense that he wanted to share his art with a wider audience to show that letterpress was capable of producing actual art, and to contribute to the field he was passionate about. The Sibelius-print was showcased at the 1938 International Handicraft Exhibition in Berlin , and was featured in the Printing Art Quarterly -magazine , alongside the works of A. M. Cassandre, J. C. Leyendecker and László Moholy-Nagy.

Malmiola’s art would not have come to be without the support of his foreman Atte Syvänne, the technical director of the K. K. Printing, and member of Kirjapainotaito editorial staff. Under his leadership, the K. K. Printing had evolved into a well known general printing house in Finland. Syvänne was known for encouraging his employees, and it’s apparent, that in his role as Malmiola’s supervisor (or as the overseer of Malmiola’s own supervisors), he actively supported Malmiola’s interest in pictorial typesetting.

It’s also worth noting that not many foremen in the printing industry would have allowed the use of valuable resources, such as 30 000 ciceros worth of brass rule, for personal “hobby” projects. But Syvänne shared a passion for the art of printing with Malmiola, and permitted him to use resources for his experiments.

Syvänne also dabbled in pictorial typography himself, and one of his experiments appear on the cover of Kirjapainotaito in June 1936, a year before Malmiola’s Sibelius-print. This might have influenced and inspired Malmiola in his own typographic experiments.

Figure 21. Atte Syvänne’s cover for Kirjapainotaito -magazine is made with brass rule

Valto Malmiola’s Short Biography

As a morbid contrast to the playfulness of his work, I found out that he was a supporter for Nazi ideology after reading his article “Työn aateluus”. This, of course, casts a shadow on his legacy and I debated for a long time if I should even write about him. But, because I already sunk a lot of time into this research, and because his art is unique in the context of (Finnish) typography, and because his work is part of a bigger typographic phenomena, I decided to go ahead anyway. While his work is fascinating, it’s important to view his person with a critical understanding of this context. That said, fuck nazis and fuck Malmiola, may he rot in hell.

Art has almost always been a status symbol. Kings and queens adorned their palaces with ornate portraits and sculptures. Religious leaders commissioned Renaissance masters to adorn their holy places. These days, owning a Banksy or a Yayoi Kusama makes you someone to pay attention to — and celebrities, billionaires, and even banks are jumping on board the collecting train.

Some collectors focus on specific art movements, some focus on specific artists, and some focus on specific countries. Some focus on quantity, while others focus on quality. Some lend their collections to museums, while others keep their artwork privately displayed.

And most of these collections are extraordinary.

When Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud purchased “Salvator Mundi,” a painting attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, for $450.3 million in 2017, the Christie’s auction crowd gasped as they witnessed the sale of the most expensive painting purchased at public auction. Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen’s private art collection fetched over $1.6 billion at auction in 2022 — it included works by Vincent Van Gogh, Gustav Klimt, Georgia O’Keeffe, Edward Hopper, Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, David Hockney, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein, and Sandro Botticelli.

The largest private art collection in the world, valued at around $3 billion, belongs to mega-dealers Ezra and David Nahmad. The chairman of Christie’s New York claimed the brothers have sold “more art than anyone alive.” The Nahmads loan some of their art to major museums, but they also store their pieces in a massive art warehouse that holds around 5,000 pieces — including almost 300 works by Pablo Picasso worth an estimated $1 billion.
